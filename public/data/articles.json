If you are\npart of Mike's world it is not a choice to not come on Tuesday-Thursday.\n\nIf you schedule personal appointments unless inflexible or urgent, set\nthem up for Monday or Friday. As required also take the day(s) off.\n\nMany of us come even on Mondays and Fridays, so while I don't expect\nanyone to be here 5 days a week (it may become a mandate at some point)\nif you cannot make it on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday then find\nanother proxy day.\n\nI have seen that many in the younger generations are forgetting that we\nwent to schools and colleges, we attended for 5 days and in many cases\n5.5 days. Sometimes we attended vivas and special lectures even on a\nSunday. All of a sudden there is an entitled mindset. Not sure why???\n\nIf any of you owned your business you would run it exactly like this. So\nhelp me run this setup as if we all owned this place together.

    "content": "Sunday thoughts:\n\nWhat a great question to ask the CEO of Snowflake and even a greater\nresponse. Before you see that\n\nHere is my take: I want to see a Snowvation use case that ingests large\ndata set (event logs, authentication/authorization logs or telemetry\ndata sets) with SNOWPIPE, transform as required, modeled as UNISTORE\ncapable, with an ML model built to train the data set and a possible\napp/UI to leverage SNOWPARK/STREAMLIT and respond to below thoughts from\nMark Ronald. The app should build conversational AI interpretations of\nthe logs to respond to user queries. Thoughts/Takers??\n\nMark Ronald\n\nOkay. As a follow-up, Frank, I wanted to ask you on the topic of\ngenerative AI and large language models. Can you frame up the\nopportunity there for Snowflake because I would think with the Unistore,\nyou could probably handle all these chat logs. You could be training\nsome of these models on very large data sets. I would think that\nSnowpipe\\'s can pull in social media feeds and kind of help to improve\nthose models. You see any customer activity around that vector or any\ntailwinds you think that could be developing in time?\n\nFrank Slootman\n\nWell, it\\'s still early in the cycle. Obviously, like everybody else,\nwe\\'re all over it in terms of evaluating where these technologies can\nmake a difference. I mean the things that we sort of hone in on short\nterm, is called completion code optimizations, things that are very,\nvery clear business returns.\n\nOne of the challenges with these new technologies that people come up\nwith a lot of interesting questions, but without a solid business model\nthat\\'s not going to take off. So we take a very pragmatic view. We do\nanticipate that Snowflake data will be a very, very big driver of large\nlanguage model in conjunction with many, many other data sources. So we\nthink that the gravity around data will drive a lot of this action\nactivity to our platform.\n\nConcluding with an Oxymoron: Your job will not become obsolete if you\nare thinking about how your skills will become obsolete in 5 years from\nnow."

Often, when we narrate about the members of our team we first think of the people who we depend on, ones who make us proud and the ones that usually follow our lead. Simple and easy enough. Not quite.\n\nAs you would think of the people that work for you, your manager might think of you as a part of her/his team similarly. So of course, yet another thought to reflect on your manager as a member of your team - I owe it to this person.\n\nOne of the 16 things in my sweet-16 list of leadership qualities, peer relationships play an important role. Think about this - the most difficult group to work alongside is going to be peers, whether you are a leader or not, as we implicitly compete with them. Your ability to work with your peers will make your leader's job much easier. It will allow him/her to work on bigger opportunities. Peer relationship will accelerate the trust within the organization and often against our discomfort this becomes a key skill to develop. Imagine the impact on our productivity and culture, if your leader has to spend a lot of time resolving disputes within the team.\n\nOn the macro front, many countries including BRICS are evaluating to trade in non-US dollar currencies for their commerce. This will potentially change how the US dollar is used as an intermediary. Besides this there is some more attention largely given to non-regulated currency in the form of crypto, given that the regulated fiat currencies are going through unpredictable movements. Also as a result, gold prices have appreciated 15-20% in the last 6 months.\n\nLastly, being curious is so important. I had met a young man in Goa a few years ago and I saw his name on his uniform, it read 'Arlindo'. I asked him what it meant - he said no idea. I met another young girl similarly last week during the customer show case in Mumbai. I asked what 'Eralinda' meant and she had no idea. I had looked both of them up, 'Arlindo' is a name of Portuguese origin and meant an Eagle. 'Eralinda' means spirited, of Hebrew origin. She told me that I made her day by talking about it."

Here are some key takeaways from the week.\n\nOne thing that struck me was how much potential there is in the AI industry right now. It reminded me of the early days of social media and content creation, where early adopters were able to create multi-million dollar businesses by being among the first to capitalize on new platforms.\n\nNow, with AI and chatbots like ChatGPT, there is a new gold rush to capitalize on this technology. But there's also another technology that is still in development that could change the game in a big way: superconductors.\n\nSuperconductors are materials that allow objects to levitate and allow for incredibly efficient energy transfer. For example, a train could be run with just one push if it was built with superconductors, and a microprocessor based on superconductors would use only 1% of the energy compared to a semiconductor-based chip. Similarly, superconductor-based batteries would lose only 5% of their energy compared to regular chemical composition-based batteries.\n\nAlthough much of the research around superconductors is currently being done at universities, if a material could be developed that can super-conduct electricity at room temperature, it would revolutionize the AI industry. Building mag-lev trains, superconductor-based chips, efficient energy transmission, and batteries would be a piece of cake.\n\nSo, it's important to remain invested, at least intellectually, in the progressive development of energy-efficient microprocessors, content/data publishing and hosting platforms (like our Data Cloud), and core AI platform companies. Be ready to welcome the AI age and make it snow, even then."

She told me that I made her day by\ntalking about it.\n\n9 April, 2023\n\nBy now, most of you have familiarized yourself with chatGPT, if not used\nextensively. As we peel this onion, there is a divided front in the tech\nworld to decide if we temporarily hold evolution/use of AI tools or we\ncontinue with the acceleration. There are concerns primarily regarding\nwhether we should build a framework right now for regulated and safe use\nof AI tools or react after much of the damage is done. Also, imagine in\nthe world of miscreants, if chatGPT starts interacting with another AI\ntool endlessly to talk without human intervention. What would that look\nlike?\n\nA leadership thought on **Power of Adjacency:** Earlier last week, a\nyoung woman came to me for professional counseling. She had a dilemma of\nwhether to inherit and run a very successful family business or create a\nnew business from scratch. Her reservation was against how certain\nbusinesses especially in male dominant cultures do not appreciate the\nother gender.\n\nI asked her to speak with her father openly and explain to him about her\nreservations. I advised that they refine the business model to build a\nsophisticated facade that takes away the traditional male dominant\nreservations and to bring a net neutral new-age corporate view to the\ntraditional business that is an acceptable **adjacent** working model.\nIt will take a few years however not impossible to create.\n\nHow does this matter to us? Firstly, if you imagine the landscape of our\nplatform, as we moved from data warehouse on the cloud to the cloud data\nplatform and then to the de facto data cloud, we came through evolution\nof product capabilities in adjacency. We slowly but surely pulled in\nadjacent capabilities to make them part of our platform. Remember, how\nFrank mentioned in his note about us being a platform, not a tool. All\nthis happens with incorporating many new adjacent capabilities.\n\nLeadership works similarly. We struggle from having done the same thing\nfor many years. An easy transition would be for us to build skills in\nadjacency. Being a data engineer you can be a data analyst, BSA to a PM,\nQA analyst to a data analyst or even a BSA. This transition is much\neasier through job rotations in adjacent teams within the organization\nas you reduce the points of complexity from cultural familiarity. My\npersonal career trajectory has followed the trait for many years and\nwill continue to be so.\n\n16 April, 2023\n\n**Blockchain and Crypto:** I haven't touched this topic in a while. If\nthere is one thing blockchain does well, it preserves evidence\nperfectly. Tracking transactions in fiat currencies is hard -\ntransactions and fraud tracking becomes an uphill task as money moves\nthrough different hands.\n\nThough not yet largely regulated, crypto has amazing ledger tracking\nabilities. There are companies that provide data, services, and research\nto government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions and insurance\ncompanies to solve criminal cases and ensure safe access to\ncryptocurrencies. **Chain Analysis** is one such company.\n\n**AutoGPT**: Last time, I had mentioned GPT tools talking to each other.\nHere is a starting point. In this instance, just announced as part of\n**AutoGPT**, GPT tools do auto-prompting to identify and implement the\nnext task, automatically. AutoGPT was trying to create an app for a\ndeveloper, it recognized that the developer did not have Node (Tool kit\nto create server side web applications)\n\n-   It googled how to install Node on its own\n\n-   Found a stack overflow article with link\n\n-   Downloaded and Extracted for auto-install\n\n-   Spawned a server, all of this on its own\n\nThis will very soon graduate AI tools from being a coding co-pilot, to a\nPersonal Digital Assistant, managing programs/projects and auto\nassignment of tasks, follow-ups and many more use cases for auto-CRM,\nplanning a holiday and a lot more.\n\n**Uphill climb in the Mid-management:** Few thoughts for the leaders,\nespecially for mid-management. In this machine led economy, many\norganizations have changed structures to flatten leadership layers. It\nis imperative that in addition to leading super productive\norganizations, you as a leader are constantly demonstrating the ability\nto make an impact and have strong narratives of what you deliver. On a\nside note, don't take a stand on internal or external affiliation that\nsound like politics.\n\nSpeed, agility and readily available **masterstrokes** are important.\nThis was nicely demonstrated by introducing ML and ChatGPT as an\nefficiency mechanism in our QA architecture last week. Kudos to [[Nirmal\nRaisoni]{.underline}](mailto:nirmal.raisoni@snowflake.com)- a topic for\nour staff next week. Of course, Service Mesh, Templatized Reporting\n(Data Analytics) and Predictive Intelligence in ServiceNow are also very\nexciting topics. So what is your **Masterstroke** - is it ready in your\nbackpocket and how soon before you share it?"

    "content": "Earlier in April this year, I started sharing my learnings with my direct leadership team and coined it as 'Sunday Thoughts'. I am expanding the outreach after receiving some input to share with the larger audience.\n\nWhere is AI?\n\nA lot has transpired with Generative AI this year, which has been a key topic of interest for me along with macroeconomics, geopolitics and our beloved Data Cloud. AI coin has two sides like anything else: one that will probably reshape and displace jobs/industries and another side that will stand up to beat the next pandemic, climate crisis, energy challenges and asteroids. We need to embrace AI through constant education and awareness.\n\nMore than a decade ago, I was introduced to terms like SDDC (Software Defined Data Center) and SD-WAN (Software Defined Wide Area Network). Virtual Machines enabled Software Defined Data Centers where these logical machines were connected over Software Defined Network. We are seeing a lot more activities in Software and Hardware driven AI capabilities.\n\nRecently, there were major announcements about the NVIDIA Omniverse™ Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE). Let's examine this a bit more by reviewing a few terms.\n\nUniverse: All of the space along with time context represent our universe (Uni for one)\n\nMultiverse: Multiple universes exist in a multiverse (parallel), beyond our observable universe (Multi for many)\n\nOmniverse: Collection of every single universe, including multiverses represent Omniverse (Omni for All inclusive)\n\nMetaverse: This is an immersive virtual world which facilitated by Virtual Reality (hence Meta)\n\nNow imagine, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine where Metaverse meets AI. This as I understand is a single, shared, immersive, persistent, 3D virtual space where humans experience life in ways they could not in the physical world. Imagine physical factories for Chips (ICs), Batteries, Electric Vehicles and others are virtualized/digitalized in an immersive platform, they are now redesigned and improved in the NVIDIA Omniverse ACE before the actual physical factories are changed. I am personally excited to hear more about this at our Summit where we will have Frank Slootman speak with Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA. Hopefully there is further intersection of our Data Cloud in this Metaverse at some point.\n\nAnother topic on the leadership styles to review is the 'HIPPO Effect'. The HIPPO effect describes a cognitive bias according to which the opinion of the highest paid person receives more attention. We all deal with this situation many times and our leadership posture of going (being) direct will make an oxymoron out of this context. I encourage you all to not build a bigger HIPPO out of the leaders that you interact with. This would mean that you need to find the right place and right time to provide thoughts and inputs for you to be heard. Don't be a yes (wo)man and figure out a way to share your perspectives and don't use the watercooler to share your thoughts, go to the source.\n\nHave you seen a Hippo? Are you one?"

You saw that with Microsoft Windows, Google Search, perhaps even a local electricity company or a national railway agency.\n\nDifferentiating and Competing with Threads\n\nComparatively, you have Facebook, YouTube, Whatsapp, Instagram, TikTok, SnapChat, Pinterest, Reddit, Linked, Twitter and many others representing a sea of offerings as competitive social/professional media for the individuals. To add to this wonderland, Meta recently announced its Threads platform and you would wonder why.\n\n-   Twitter is working to limit number of views of its platforms in order to avoid harvesting of its data sets so it turns out to be a an opportunity for a new player\n\n-   At the same time, to be a player in the LLM game, you need a platform rich of textual (language) data which neither Facebook nor Instagram is\n\n-   Using Twitter as it competes with traditional media and enables citizen journalism, Threads will become another player\n\n-   Threads can remain more agnostic of fake news compared to the other social media platforms\n\nOf course, there is a wave of subscribers that jumped on to meet this new kid on the block. Whether it offers a new differential value or not is another question that will only be answered with time.\n\nDifferentiating and Competing with ChatGPT\n\nSimilarly, ChatGPT had a reduced number of users and usage in the recent past. Has the excitement for the new kid on the block faded, are there more competitive players and there isn't much of a differential offering or is it that given the summer holidays students who used OpenAI/ChatGPT, reduced the usage. ChatGPT has just about 4 Million paying subscribers and of these only 500,000 users use non-prompt based interface to invoke API calls in OpenAI.\n\nMind you, a lot of advances in physical sciences, healthcare (creation of new drugs), and making software development autonomous will be some of the significant transformations with API based usage of the LLMs to provide a differential value and offering. As such the number of 'consumer' use cases will reduce while increasing the consumption in the 'enterprise' businesses, which is a big success criteria for a software business.\n\nDifferentiating and Competing with Self\n\nThis raises a question as an individual: is there competition that I deal with - what is my resilience to the perceived competition. What is my differential offering? Be like a racehorse, put the blinders on to not look sideways and aim for your goal. Play to win like a Golf player, make your next shot better than the previous one and create a better version of you."

    "content": "Technology Macros: Then, Now and the Future\n\nAbout a decade ago, the combined Market Capitalization of Facebook (~$100B), Apple (~$425B), Amazon ($140B), Netflix (~$20B), Microsoft ($280B) and Google (~$300B) was valued at ~$1.2 Trillion.\n\nToday Meta (~$800), Apple (~$2.86T), Amazon (~$1.43T), Netflix (~$191B ), Microsoft (~$2.44T) and Google (~$1.62T) amass Market Capitalization in the order of ~$9.3 Trillion.\n\nComparatively, in the last 10 years, the United States' GDP grew from $13T to $26.2T and India's GDP grew from $1.85T to $3.75T (estimated).\n\nAs you can see, the technology sector with the 6 companies in perspective, grew disproportionately by a factor of ~8 compared to the GDP growth by a factor of ~2. This represents 17.5% annual growth of technology businesses for 10 years in a row.\n\nIn the duration of Covid years, largely from mid of 2020 up until mid 2022, technology and countries experienced massive boost from the free money flowing into the system through stimulus spends, quantitative easing and very low interest rates. Besides the super high and unrealistic technology valuations, this led to a surge in how crypto currencies and digital assets like NFTs were appreciated.\n\nLast 18 months changed the game. Between the Ukraine-Russia war, rising inflation, rising cost of fuel prices, supply chain crisis and rising interest rates, the liquidity tightened significantly. As a result, as witnessed, a lot of technology companies are restructuring or doing down rounds and the free money is going away. Many of the technology company valuations, which were valued at 15-18 times the revenue in mid 2020, saw a valuation drop to 3-4 times the revenue, at this point.\n\nAs we look into the future, major technology players will continue to prosper and possible valuations can grow to be 2.5 or 3 times in the next decade (from $10T to $25T-30T). As the valuations continue to grow, the players and the underlying enablement of technology platforms will go through a series of changes enabled by AI, Data, Compute, Power Efficiency and other Platform leverages.\n\nRecently, I discussed 16 leadership development factors with my management team. One of the key perspectives that I expect leaders (and all the individuals) to be aware of is 'Macro/Industry trends'. It is imperative that we stay abreast of the modern technology stack, the data cloud, LLM shifts, leverage of LLMs on the new data sets, impact of compute (GPUs and Quantum Computing), strengthening our Security posture, Power Efficiencies, and evolution of Technology Macros in each of the Industry Verticals. These narratives will help us drive our strategies, thought leadership and representation of our brands/identities as individuals.\n\nWe also need to understand a Macro view of us as an individual, to know our past, our present and the trajectory into the future. Do you?"

    "content": "Few inquisitive souls asked me for the list of 9 countries that still hold the AAA credit rating. They are Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Singapore and Australia, with 7 based in Europe in addition to Singapore and Australia. This week, I am pulling together dimensions of Geopolitics, Macroeconomics and Technology representing shared intricacies between them.\n\nGlobal order for Geopolitical Warfare, Economies and Digitalization in today's world is led by different entities.\n\nGeopolitical Warfare Order: 5 decades back the power of warfare resided primarily between the United States and USSR. After the collapse of the USSR, the United States remained to be the powerhouse for quite some time. In recent years, following China's rise both in economic stature and warfare, many of the Asian countries are becoming stronger allies of the United States and are increasingly dependent on the United States. Similarly, following the Russia-Ukraine war the NATO driven EU countries are similarly becoming increasingly dependent on the United States. Defense/Wars have increased our dependence on technology to support Telecommunications (remember, the Starlink reference in Ukraine), cybersecurity and technology enabled weaponry.\n\nMacroeconomic Order: This posture is multipolar compared to the bipolarity of the arms race illustrated between the US' ability to support wars globally and China's dominance in Asia. For the last few decades the US and China were interdependent for the supply chain and economic growth. Following disinflation (which can be a far bigger economic curse than inflation) and other macroeconomic shifts the today's world has many players that challenge the economic positions of the top 2 economies of the US and China. Between many of the big EU countries, Japan and the emergence of India, the Macroeconomic power remains distributed and will continue staying subdivided to be in a multipolar state. This renders a leaderless Macroeconomic posture for the coming decades.\n\nDigitalization Order: This is a very unique aspect which is not run by big economies but by companies, many of which have much larger market capitalization than the GDP of many countries. If the companies build alliances with specific countries then their ability to compete in the global markets will dilute and the world will remain digitally divided and isolated. There is a staggering amount of world power that sits in the algorithms of these companies whether they drive AI based platforms, social media platforms or healthcare based innovations. Our world cannot afford this subdivision to deal with the crisis that the planet will face from weather and virus based threats.\n\nLooking back at the Macroeconomic view, is it really good for the world to be multipolar with a leaderless posture? I think so. Here is an analogy to draw. Since we practically diluted the HQ mindset of Snowflake, the geographic and functional subdivisions of the company have a great ability to act in independence for all of us to think and build the HQ mindset in our being. Similarly for many countries, challenges of over-dependence on manufacturing, energy and technology powerhouses will reduce significantly.\n\nSo moving from countries, to companies and to individuals, how does this apply to each of us? Are you super-dependent on a few people for intellectual and knowledge nourishments? You can craft time out to nourish your mind, body and intellect to become increasingly independent. Do you?\n\nThoughts provoked through Courtesy of one of 2023's top 10 Ted Talks:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uiUPD-z9DTg?si=LekKXXZLlGZ66paW"

    "content": "Premise of Energy\n\nEnergy has been a root cause of economic growth and of many wars. Non-renewable sources have, if not depleting, have been impacting the environment in a big way. This necessitates significant innovation in both consumption efficiency of non-renewable energy sources and creation of renewable energy from solar, wind, and nuclear technologies.\n\nRenewable Geothermal Energy Supply\n\nA big new research underway is in leverage of geothermal energy. In the United States companies like Fervo Energy have initiated research to tap into clan, abundant power of geothermal resources using drilling techniques adapted from the oil & gas sector.\n\n-   Traditional geothermal plants tap into natural hot water reservoirs underground to convert heat energy to electrical energy. However, hot water reservoirs don't exist in abundance\n\n-   What exists is geothermal heat in hot and dry rocks below earth's surface so now we can drill into these rocks and create geothermal reservoirs by pumping water which can heated through fracking and produce geothermal energy\n\n-   This energy can be provided 24x7 unlike solar and wind sources and emits no greenhouse gasses\n\n-   More research is required to reduce the cost to scale this method, ensure that this gets state sponsorship from countries around and to understand the impact on water usage and to avoid earthquakes triggering from drilling activities\n\n-   This innovation is a natural extension of oil & gas companies for them to be participants\n\nEfficiencies of Electric Vehicles (Non-renewable Energy Sources)\n\nOver the years technology companies have continuously increased efficiencies and reduced costs of their offerings. Snowflake has done similarly. It is possible only when the total markets, customer base, market share, and innovative offerings continue to increase. This way individual customers/consumers benefit while the companies grow as a whole.\n\nTesla's model S price reduced from $105,000 to $75,000 and model X price reduced from $121,000 to $80,000 between the start of the month and 1st September. This happens alongside when there are continuous hardware and software improvements. They continue to innovate to get closer to FSD (Full Self-Driving).\n\n-   General Motors market cap is worth $45B for generating $169B annual revenue, delivering 692k cars in Q2 2023 and from generating $2.5B in net profit for the same quarter\n\n-   Comparatively, Tesla's market cap is worth $800B for generating $90B annual revenue,delivering 466k cars in Q2 2023 and from generating $2.1B in net profit for the same quarter\n\nGM from making more revenue and selling more cars is still about 6% of Tesla's market capitalization. Whether this is an anomaly for the growth potential or an irony, only time can tell.\n\nTakeaway\n\nBrands, growth mindset & cultures do matter in creating new markets, new products and acquiring new customers. Are you attached to such a brand? Are you proud?"

Without judging whether the firing happened for the known Q* research potentially leading to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) or any other reason, let's examine how they reacted to the situation -\n\n-   First they quickly shared their appreciation for OpenAI employees, followers and wished everyone well\n\n-   Their confidence in their own ability to move forward to the next phase did not deter them from what transpired, this is what I like to call Iteration Velocity\n\n-   Sam mentioned in one of his tweets that he pretty much saw Eulogy post his death. He rose back like a Phoenix, quickly (https://twitter.com/sama/status/1725742088317534446)\n\n-   Microsoft and the OpenAI internal org responded quickly however both, Sam and Greg, did not expect any such reaction. They demonstrated relentlessness\n\nBringing this back home, we cannot control what happens around us however we can definitely control how we respond to adversities. This needs training of your mind and body to have confident stimuli to events that ordinarily shake the ground below.\n\nThis whole narrative reminded me of our core Snowflake values\n\n-   Between every event and response there is an opportunity to introduce positivity in the space between. Own it,Think Big\n\n-   Sam could not control how they thought to determine his exit however at the face of it, he did Embrace Differences of Others\n\n-   His commitment to Being Excellent was not a function of life events\n\nDo you recall any situations in your life where you were shaken or remained undeterred when all hell broke loose? Looking forward to hearing experiences you have had and consequent learnings.\n\nBeyond this, since the drama at OpenAI distracted us this past week, to make sure we continue to stay up to date, Here are some recent updates from the world of LLMs -\n\n-   Google announced Bard AI support for deciphering content from youtube videos to answer specific questions\n\n-   Anthropic's Claude 2.1 will support 200,000 tokens equivalent to 500,000 words or 500 pages in the context window, which is an immediate context input that the model considers while it generates output\n\n-   Microsoft announced Orca 2 Small Language Model with enhanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models. Orca 2 is based on 7 Billion or 13 Billion parameters created by fine-tuning corresponding LLAMA 2 models from Meta. Understand that OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.0 is built on 2T+ parameters which are almost 300 times more than 7B parameters.\n\n-   Inflection AI released the Inflection 2.0 model that claims to be second in performance behind GPT 4.0 from OpenAI\n\n-   Elon Musk announced availability xAI's Grok language model based on the content from the X platform to its premium customers"

    "content": "World Bank and the Banks of the World\n\nI was intrigued by a talk from Ajay Banga about his new position as the President of the World Bank which inspired me to capture these thoughts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTeJOzCoXO8&t=636s\n\nWorld Bank: World Bank is, both, a financial institution and a knowledge bank. Last year, they managed $120B in lending to low and middle income countries needing help. Working with these countries, the Bank maintains a high level of knowledge and intellect around issues related to the planet's health, people's wellbeing, infrastructure needs, and digitalization progress worldwide.\n\nThere is a perception today that the world bank is not fit for purpose. As much as the Bank manages huge lending amounts, there has been criticism around how long it takes to execute projects.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a global financial institution, comprising 190 member countries. The IMF focuses on providing short-term financial assistance to countries facing economic crises, emphasizing macroeconomic policies. It's lauded for providing crucial support during financial turmoil but criticized for imposing strict conditions on loans.\n\nCentral Banks: Central banks are crucial in their respective countries' economic policy-making and have significant impact on global financial markets.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed), USA; European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, People's Bank of China, Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of India are some of the largest central banks in the world.\n\nGovernment Run Banks: Government-owned or state-controlled banks often play a role in implementing government policies, supporting economic sectors, or providing financial services where private banks may be less active.\n\nPrivate Banks: To my surprise, First 4 of the Top 5 private banks based on total value of the assets managed are based in China. JPMorgan Chase & Co is the number 5 of the list and is the largest bank in the United States. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank are the top 3 private banks in India by asset valuation.\n\nNot losing traction on developments in the AI world, here are some more updates.\n\nLarge Vision Models: Similar to the introduction of Small Language Models earlier, I want to quickly mention Large Vision Models. Large Vision Models are used to learn from images however to not complicate learnings from vast complexity of images the Vision Models are built to be domain specific. For example most images on the internet are of humans, objects, abstractions and animals. To not confuse these images from subject matter relations, training models solely from domain specific images will immensely help in the field of pathology, circuitry, aerial views and others. Also given the domain specificity the learning will require far fewer parameters (only 10-30%) than a generic image based Large Vision Model would require.\n\nGemini from Google: Google recently announced its Gemini LLM platform in 3 sizes - Ultra, Pro and Nano. These models as announced are built ground up to be multi-modal, to say that they were trained on text, images, voice and video. The Gemini Ultra model as reported outperformed ChatGPT 4.0 on most parameters, although it will not be available for another year. Compared to Dall.E capability in OpenAI, Gemini cannot generate images today. Google's Bard will start using the Pro model as the LLM base and Pixel phones will leverage the Gemini Nano model.\n\nApparently the Duck video image drawing interpretation of the bird, the colors and material detection is kind of fake, as claimed by TechCrunch. I am going - What the duck?\n\nDomain specific lvms - circuits; pathology; aerial views and general images like on insta and meta = you can save time as lvms act as pre-built templates and require\n\nOnly 10-30% labelled data\n\nGemini from google deep mind - in 3 sizes ultra, pro and nano - built ground up yo be multi-modal - text, audio, images and video; ultra outperformed gpt 4.0 - although not available for another year; current releases do not generate images unlike dall.e on ChatGPT - no clarification from google about training data ; bard will use Gemini pro and pixel will use Gemini nano"

Last year, they managed \\$120B in lending to low and\nmiddle income countries needing help. Working with these countries, the\nBank maintains a high level of knowledge and intellect around issues\nrelated to the planet's health, people's wellbeing, infrastructure\nneeds, and digitalization progress worldwide.\n\nThere is a perception today that the world bank is not fit for purpose.\nAs much as the Bank manages huge lending amounts, there has been\ncriticism around how long it takes to execute projects.\n\n**International Monetary Fund (IMF):** The International Monetary Fund\n(IMF) is a global financial institution, comprising 190 member\ncountries. The IMF focuses on providing short-term financial assistance\nto countries facing economic crises, emphasizing macroeconomic policies.\nIt\\'s lauded for providing crucial support during financial turmoil but\ncriticized for imposing strict conditions on loans.\n\n**Central Banks:** Central banks are crucial in their respective\ncountries\\' economic policy-making and have significant impact on global\nfinancial markets.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed), USA; European Central Bank, Bank of Japan,\nPeople's Bank of China, Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of India\nare some of the largest central banks in the world.\n\n**Government Run Banks:** Government-owned or state-controlled banks\noften play a role in implementing government policies, supporting\neconomic sectors, or providing financial services where private banks\nmay be less active.\n\n**Private Banks:** To my surprise, First 4 of the Top 5 private banks\nbased on total value of the assets managed are based in China. JPMorgan\nChase & Co is the number 5 of the list and is the largest bank in the\nUnited States. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank are the top 3\nprivate banks in India by asset valuation.\n\nNot losing traction on developments in the AI world, here are some more\nupdates.\n\n**Large Vision Models:** Similar to the introduction of Small Language\nModels earlier, I want to quickly mention Large Vision Models. Large\nVision Models are used to learn from images however to not complicate\nlearnings from vast complexity of images the Vision Models are built to\nbe domain specific. For example most images on the internet are of\nhumans, objects, abstractions and animals. To not confuse these images\nfrom subject matter relations, training models solely from domain\nspecific images will immensely help in the field of pathology,\ncircuitry, aerial views and others. Also given the domain specificity\nthe learning will require far fewer parameters (only 10-30%) than a\ngeneric image based Large Vision Model would require.\n\n**Gemini from Google:** Google recently announced its Gemini LLM\nplatform in 3 sizes - Ultra, Pro and Nano. These models as announced are\nbuilt ground up to be multi-modal, to say that they were trained on\ntext, images, voice and video. The Gemini Ultra model as reported\noutperformed ChatGPT 4.0 on most parameters, although it will not be\navailable for another year. Compared to Dall.E capability in OpenAI,\nGemini cannot generate images today. Google's Bard will start using the\nPro model as the LLM base and Pixel phones will leverage the Gemini Nano\nmodel.\n\nApparently the Duck video image drawing interpretation of the bird, the\ncolors and material detection is kind of fake, as claimed by TechCrunch.\nI am going - **What the duck?**\n\nDomain specific lvms - circuits; pathology; aerial views and general\nimages like on insta and meta = you can save time as lvms act as\npre-built templates and require\n\nOnly 10-30% labelled data\n\nGemini from google deep mind - in 3 sizes ultra, pro and nano - built\nground up yo be multi-modal - text, audio, images and video; ultra\noutperformed gpt 4.0 - although not available for another year; current\nreleases do not generate images unlike dall.e on ChatGPT - no\nclarification from google about training data ; bard will use Gemini pro\nand pixel will use Gemini nano\n\n**December 3 2023**\n\n**Power Needs**\n\nWe have figured out that to run our Data Centers, Crypto processes,\nEclectic Vehicles based on lithium ion batteries, and LLMs based on\nextensive computing, necessitate a lot of energy consumption largely in\nthe form of burning of fossils. In the coming years, a lot more power\nwill be required to run our planet and the carbon emission from these\ntransformations continue to negatively impact the state of our planet's\nhealth.\n\nOur need for energy continues to grow and we cannot sustain generating\nenergy from nonrenewable sources. As alternative sources of energy,\nwhere the sun is shining we should have solar panels and where the wind\nis blowing we should have the wind power - which are still not enough to\nsustain our energy needs and definitely necessitate exploration of\nadditional renewable sources of energy.\n\n**Energy Abundance through Nuclear Fusion**\n\nThe Sun is powered by a process of fusion in the core where extreme\npressure and temperature cause hydrogen nuclei to collide and fuse into\nhelium, releasing a massive amount of energy in the form of light and\nheat, powering the Sun and providing energy to the solar system. This\nexact same process is being experimented to create limitless clean\nenergy through extensive research in creation of fusion based energy\nplants.\n\n-   Essentially, the energy produced by fusion is 200 million times per\n    > mass used compared to what is produced by a chemical reaction.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   There are 70 fusion companies currently researching to put fusion\n    > reactions in a machine to generate nuclear energy.\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Imagine going to a coal site to take out the boiler. Replace the\n    > boiler with the fusion machine, turn the switch on to generate\n    > heat/energy, no emission and no fossil fuel involved in the\n    > process.\n\nA typical process involved injecting fusion fuel (mixture of hydrogen\nand helium). Compression of fusion fuels increases pressure, density and\ntemperature. At 100 million degrees leading to fusion conditions fuel\nbecomes plasma -- the fourth state of matter where electrons are\nstripped from their atoms, creating a mix of free electrons and ions.\nThis process releases massive amounts of energy.\n\nThese companies are still in the research mode and it will be another\ndecade when we will have directions to new sources and material impact\nfrom these transformations. The race to cost effective and harmless\npower generation in abundance is on.\n\n**What powers you as an individual and how do you manage to limit\ntoxicity in your space to be carbon neutral if not net negative? How do\nyou remain agnostic of negative space around? Do share your thoughts.**\n\n**November 26 2023**\n\n**Expect the Unexpected: Iteration Velocity**\n\nWhile working with one my CEOs in the past, we would do two things in\npreparation of presenting to him:\n\n-   Write all the research and highlight summaries in 80 words or less,\n    > with one slide to show: the Problem/Opportunity, the Ask and\n    > Potential Outcomes from making the choice or not\n\n-   Secondly, after all the preparation, we would always expect the\n    > **unexpected** **outcomes** and questions from the meetings\n\nDid Sam Altman and Greg Brockman expect to be ousted the way they were\nfired? Without judging whether the firing happened for the known Q\\*\nresearch potentially leading to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) or\nany other reason, let's examine how they reacted to the situation -\n\n-   First they quickly shared their appreciation for OpenAI employees,\n    > followers and wished everyone well\n\n-   Their confidence in their own ability to move forward to the next\n    > phase did not deter them from what transpired, this is what I like\n    > to call **Iteration Velocity**\n\n-   Sam mentioned in one of his tweets that he pretty much saw Eulogy\n    > post his death. He rose back like a Phoenix, quickly\n    > (https://twitter.com/sama/status/1725742088317534446)\n\n-   Microsoft and the OpenAI internal org responded quickly however\n    > both, Sam and Greg, did not expect any such reaction. They\n    > demonstrated relentlessness\n\nBringing this back home, we cannot control what happens around us\nhowever we can definitely control how we respond to adversities. This\nneeds training of your mind and body to have confident stimuli to events\nthat ordinarily shake the ground below.\n\nThis whole narrative reminded me of our core Snowflake values\n\n-   Between every event and response there is an opportunity to\n    > introduce positivity in the space between. **Own it**,**Think\n    > Big**\n\n-   Sam could not control how *they* thought to determine his exit\n    > however at the face of it, he did **Embrace Differences of\n    > Others**\n\n-   His commitment to **Be**ing **Excellent** was not a function of life\n    > events\n\nDo you recall any situations in your life where you were shaken or\nremained undeterred when all hell broke loose? Looking forward to\nhearing experiences you have had and consequent learnings.\n\nBeyond this, since the drama at OpenAI distracted us this past week, to\nmake sure we continue to stay up to date, Here are some recent updates\nfrom the world of LLMs -\n\n-   Google announced **Bard AI** support for deciphering content from\n    > youtube videos to answer specific questions\n\n-   Anthropic's **Claude 2.1** will support 200,000 tokens equivalent to\n    > 500,000 words or 500 pages in the context window, which is an\n    > immediate context input that the model considers while it\n    > generates output\n\n-   Microsoft announced **Orca 2 Small Language Model** with enhanced\n    > reasoning abilities of Large Language Models.

I was\ntempted to write more about the OpenAI story however refrained as the\nevents are still unfolding. \"[पिक्चर अभी बाकी है!\"]{.mark}\n\n[I also realized that the AI/LLM space is unfolding rapidly and before\nwe all get thoroughly intimidated by these I am providing this re-cap\nand additions as a refresher and an update for those who would like to\nremain up-to-date.]{.mark}\n\n[**Generative AI**: Word Generative refers to \"Generate\". GenAI\ngenerates texts, images, lyrics, music and code based on what the model\nis trained. As a result Language Models are representatives of\nGenerative AI.]{.mark}\n\n[**SLMs or Small Language Models**: are similar to an LLM but operate on\na smaller scale. They are trained on less data with fewer parameters,\nwhich makes them less complex. They are built on millions of parameters\ncompared to hundreds of billion parameters for LLMs. An example of a\nsmall language model is to solve a limited problem like a virtual\nassistant on a smartphone where there aren't enough computational\nresources and the response from the model is fast owing to not many\nparameters.]{.mark}\n\n[**RAG or Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Here the tasks are performed\nas a combination of both retrieval and generation. Generation is\nAugmented to Retrieval. Imagine you are supporting customers as a\ntelevision company. Usually, for troubleshooting and support you can use\ndata from the published manuals (unstructured data set) and details like\npatches etc. This information is proprietary to the company so in a RAG\nmodel, first you use proprietary dataset to **retrieve** specific\ninformation and augment LLMs to generate **coherent** responses. As a\nresult, your retrieval mechanism is based on a specific dataset and\ngeneration uses widely available LLMs.]{.mark}\n\n[**Snowflake supercharging the Data Cloud with LLM capabilities:** We\nannounced **Snowflake Cortex** as the ability for our customers (in\nprivate preview) to securely tap into the power of generative AI with\ntheir enterprise data.

Fun does not mean scrolling social media or watching\nOTT. Fun should be a feeling and not an activity. Fun should be about\nplayfulness, lowering your guard and connecting.

Share\nyour thoughts\n\n**November 5 2023**\n\n**A Tale of Two Tenancies**\n\nTraditional business models of Healthcare, Hospitality, Banking,\nAutomotive, Retail are enhanced with Digital Revolution and in many\ncases challenged by new players like TelaDoc, AirBnB, PayTM, Google-Pay,\nTesla, Amazon, Shopify and many others.\n\nThere were such opportunities in the tenancy space, one with a\ncommercial office space model initiated by WeWork and other intending to\ncreate a global Travel Experiences from AirBnB. Assuming many of you\nhave heard of WeWork readying to file chapter 11 (Bankruptcy), let's\ntake a look at what transpired.\n\nA long 2+ year tenure during the pandemic resulted in constraints that\nkept us away from pleasure traveling and of course going to the office.\n\nThis is what transpired for WeWork in a nutshell\n\n-   WeWork's business model intended to provide office floors, lounges,\n    > desks and meeting rooms on somewhat a la carte lease basis for\n    > startups, freelancers and smaller establishments that could not\n    > afford significant capital investment\n\n-   To lure these businesses, WeWork made significant capital\n    > investments, both in establishing long leases with landlords and\n    > for buildout of the workspace infrastructure in total of 777 work\n    > locations across 39 countries\n\n-   Founded in 2010, the company was valued at \\$47B in 2019 with shares\n    > trading over \\$400.

Have you experienced such a mindset in\nyour work life? What parallels do you draw? Do share your thoughts.\n\n**October 29 2023**\n\n**Perseverance All the Way**\n\nA lot of professional media was divided, or I must say largely irked\nwith comments on long working hours. Some put a capitalist perspective,\nand some addressed it with a geographic context, given that some\ncountries limit number of working hours/days.\n\nIt got me to think about few of my favourite leaders and here are some\nperspectives in no particular order.\n\nDominic Gallello, my CEO a few companies back, shared this beautiful\nquote years ago and it still resonates in my routine life.\n\n\"Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will\nnot; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius\nwill not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the\nworld is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone\nare omnipotent.\" -- Calvin Coolidge\n\nIn his just a minute long message, Barrack Obama, erstwhile President of\nthe United States addresses the youth to learn how to get stuff done.\nThere are many of us who are great at explaining problems, why something\nwent wrong or why something can't be fixed. One must build an attitude\nto say, 'let me take care of that'. He/She must learn to handle tasks\nand get them done. Don't be impatient, don't look for a plum assignment\nand just nail the stuff you are working on. Leaders notice all the good\nstuff you do.\n\n[[President Barack Obama: Just learn how to get stuff\ndone]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNY4UFaHbP4&list=PPSV)\n\nMany of our leaders also work with great perseverance. Frank, our CEO\nnever misses to address the whole company on Monday mornings with his\nawe-inspiring message.\n\nI, personally believe in giving my best to the job at hand. Rewards and\nrecognition are by products of my actions and not the goals to begin\nwith.\n\nYour time is yours and you have choices to make above and beyond your\nbaseline job.\n\nDo you think differently? Do you have thoughts or your unique approach\nfor perseverance? I will look forward to hearing from you, on our fridge\nwebsite, of course.\n\n**October 22 2023**\n\nHave you ever imagined or talked about a pill that could be a substitute\nto eating food?

We set expectations on what should or should not be done?\nSimilarly, powerful nations tend to impose sanctions on dependent\nnations.\n\nIn either of the scenarios, whether as a human or a nation, you are\ncreating a submissive relationship for the dependent entity and limiting\ntheir potential. In a multipolar world where there are many influencing\nforces, whether being an individual or a nation in this context you will\ncritically limit your own growth potential.\n\nOrganizations work similarly and we need to work to avoid these\npitfalls. Being a people leader, it becomes significantly critical to\nbuild trust based relationships, empowered mindset built with authentic\nengagements.\n\nA video (Link at the bottom) I saw recently shares that mammals' mental\nand physical well being is a function of attachment (to others) and in\nbeing authentic.\n\n**Message and the Messenger**\n\nNow being a leader necessitates yet another attribute. We tend to get\ntoo opinionated about who said what as opposed to what was said. What\nthis really implies is for the leaders (actually all of us) to focus\nvery strongly on the message to understand what it meant irrespective of\nwho said it and how it was said.\n\n**Get your Leaders to hear your Message(s)**\n\nAnother video, which I shared with my leadership team, speaks about how\nto effectively communicate with the leaders. Sometimes, when I meet with\nindividuals and teams, I hear about perspectives on what cafeteria food\noptions should be, whether we should increase meal allowances or provide\ntransportation to the workplace.\n\nWe have a very talented workplace orgranization that is very aware of\nthe opportunities and nuances of our collective wellbeing. Your ability\nto share and pick valuable insights in interactions with leadership will\nhelp both, us as individuals and organization, to accelerate our\nrespective journeys. This talk (Link at the bottom) encapsulates 5\ncritical leadership communications techniques. Here is the nutshell:\n\n1.  **Escape the minutiae** - leadership is not interested in detail\n    > orientation or deep implementor\\'s view\n\n2.  **Exude confidence** - demonstrate certainty - grab the seat at the\n    > table\n\n3.  **Execute rainmaking communications** - avoid long winded\n    > narratives - don't try too hard to impress\n\n4.  **Elongate your timeframes** - what you will be in 3 years - think\n    > really long term - work portfolio over promotion/money - leaders\n    > think in form of decades\n\n5.  **Exercise business acumen** - think of their Big Rocks\n\n[[How Being Too Nice Can Destroy You: A Story You\\'ve Never Heard with\nDr. Gabor\nMaté]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/xChNbQ2o0Ro?si=RZS7mJ0TY_x1rM0v)\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[5 Rules for Communicating Effectively with\nExecutives]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/Fzi4T94QCjw?si=pGiY0cu6qi5NcpkH)\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| +------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n| | +-------------------------------------------------------------+  |  |\n| | |   ---------------------------- ---------------------------- |  |  |\n| | |                                                             |  |  |\n| | |   ---------------------------- ---------------------------- |  |  |\n| | +=============================================================+  |  |\n| | +-------------------------------------------------------------+  |  |\n| +==================================================================+  |\n| |                                                                  |  |\n| +------------------------------------------------------------------+  |\n+=======================================================================+\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nOctober 8 2023\n\n**Time Flies:** We are close to marking the first anniversary since\nChatGPT 3.5 was released and 25th anniversary of Google launch. So much\nhas advanced in both the phases.\n\n**AI/LLM Multimodality now a Reality:** Sam Altman, founder of OpenAI,\nannounced multimodality and as a result your ChatGPT can now see, hear\nand speak. Voice capabilities are available on iOS and Android. Also,\nOpenAI has incorporated DALL.E 3 to create images within the native\nOpenAI web interface.\n\nGoogle Bard similarly for multimodality can connect to google flights,\ngmail, google docs and google services to provide a holistic experience\nas a Bard based Personal Assistant.\n\nAdobe, Canva, Meta and many other technology-enabling companies are\nmaking similar improvements to support multimodality of inputs and\noutputs.\n\n**Smart Devices and LLMs:** Cell phones have evolved to begin with\nmobile voice communications, to short text messages, browsing the\ninternet and to where we are at in a 'App' based digital economy.\n\nOpenAI is now interested in developing a hardware project to create a\nmore natural way to interact with AI, with a \\$1B in funding from\nSoftbank and design inputs from Jony Ive, who designed the iPhone.\n\nThis can potentially replace the main smartphone interface with voice or\nvisuals. Imagine just ordering an Uber or your food with pure play voice\ninstructions compared to the current app based interface.\n\n**Fast Forwarding LLMs:** Andrej Karpathy, a computer scientist and\nex-AI leader at Tesla, shares a perspective that LLMs are shifting to a\nkernel-like representation beyond chatbots, representing a new type of\nOperating system. LLMs will soon represent a new type of driver similar\nto an operating system sitting on top of the computing infrastructure.\n\nLLMs from the traditionality of chatbot interface are becoming\nmultimodal for inputs and outputs, have code interpretation ability to\nwrite and run software programs, access the internet and support\nembeddings for both, prompting and referencing a data set.\n\n**LLMs personified with Snowflake:** It is now possible to create an\nNVIDIA based GPU compute pool, loading of tuning data inside Snowflake\nto pre-tune/pre-train using an out-of-the-box LLM using SnowPark\nContainer Service.\n\nAn additional SnowPark Container Service enables prompting and prompt\nlearning using the embeddings of the above mentioned dataset.\n\nA chat based UI can be built on Streamlit to interface with the\npre-tuned/pre-trained data set enabling continuous learning from the\ndata set.\n\n**A Narrative View:** I plan to use the above contextual framework in my\nnarrative at the LLM executive panel at the DCWT in Mumbai later this\nweek. If you have created a thought story framework in your past or if\nyou are now inspired to create something similar then I will look\nforward to hearing from you.\n\nOctober 1 2023\n\n**3 Gs of Pathway to '200 years' long life: 'Gut Health', 'Gene\nTherapies' and a 'Good Diet'**\n\n**Gut Health**\n\n-   Our body is made up of 10 trillion cells and there are about 10-40\n    > trillion cells in your gut biome (intestine)\n\n-   Gut Biome is a bacterial ecosystem similar to a rainforest filled\n    > with a range of plants, animals and other living beings\n\n-   Lot of the human diseases including diabetes, anxiety, energy levels\n    > and some more unknowns are a reflection of your gut health\n\n-   'Supergut'\n    > ([[www.supergut.com]{.underline}](http://www.supergut.com), use as\n    > an academic reference and not as advertisement) consumption can\n    > increase the count of good bacteria and shrink bad bacteria to\n    > improve overall gut health\n\n-   You can also transplant a gut biome representation of a healthy\n    > individual to another human using a treatment called Fecal\n    > Microbial Transplant (FMT), which is a transplant through feces of\n    > a healthy human\n\n-   As predicted, in another 10 years more research around gut health\n    > will significantly improve not just defense mechanism to a lot of\n    > diseases but also lead to a much longer life\n\n**Gene Therapy**\n\n-   Gene therapy is a medical technique that uses genes (good living\n    > viruses) to treat or prevent diseases by modifying or replacing\n    > faulty genetic material\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   3 distinct eras of medicinal treatment\n\n    a.

Share\nyour thoughts here\n\nSeptember 24 2023\n\n**IPOs and Direct Selling**\n\nWe all have seen IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) of companies or are\ngreatly aware of Snowflake's IPO at the least.\n\nIPOs involve a regulated process where usually an underwriting bank\nhelps issuing new shares of a company to raise capital, equivalent to\n15-20% of company's value.\n\nDirect selling allows shareholders to sell their shares directly to the\npublic without raising new capital and is not as stringent regulatorily.\nSome companies that were listed through direct selling include Slack,\nSpotify and Coinbase.\n\n**IPO Listings Then and Now**\n\nNumber of IPOs in 2023 so far has been about 600 equivalent to a market\ncapitalization of \\$60B compared to 2400 IPOs in the full year 2021\nequivalent to a market capitalization of \\$450B.\n\nNot only the number of IPOs have halved ytd but also the valuations have\ndropped to almost a quarter of what the market looked like in 2021.\n\nWe saw 3 tech IPOs in the US last week for Arm, Instacart and Klaviyo\nraising just about \\$5.5B in totality for less than 10% for each of the\ncompany's valuation.\n\nAt the face of it, IPOs sound and look great, however the long term\nperformance of the company is a much better yardstick then what happens\nat the IPO. Long term performance, working against adverse market\nconditions and growth through new product/customer baseline will define\nthe future. More than 99% of Apple, Google and many other technology\ncompanies' valuation growth is a reflection of the long term business'\nperformance.\n\n**What does it mean for us?**\n\nWith these thoughts, I want to ask some questions and look forward to\nyour responses.\n\n1.

This week, I am\npulling together dimensions of **Geopolitics**, **Macroeconomics** and\n**Technology** representing shared intricacies between them.\n\nGlobal order for **Geopolitical** **Warfare**, **Economies** and\n**Digitalization** in today's world is led by different entities.\n\n**Geopolitical** **Warfare Order**: 5 decades back the power of warfare\nresided primarily between the United States and USSR. After the collapse\nof the USSR, the United States remained to be the powerhouse for quite\nsome time. In recent years, following China's rise both in economic\nstature and warfare, many of the Asian countries are becoming stronger\nallies of the United States and are increasingly dependent on the United\nStates. Similarly, following the Russia-Ukraine war the NATO driven EU\ncountries are similarly becoming increasingly dependent on the United\nStates. Defense/Wars have increased our dependence on technology to\nsupport Telecommunications (remember, the Starlink reference in\nUkraine), cybersecurity and technology enabled weaponry.\n\n**Macroeconomic** **Order**: This posture is multipolar compared to the\nbipolarity of the arms race illustrated between the US' ability to\nsupport wars globally and China's dominance in Asia. For the last few\ndecades the US and China were interdependent for the supply chain and\neconomic growth. Following disinflation (which can be a far bigger\neconomic curse than inflation) and other macroeconomic shifts the\ntoday's world has many players that challenge the economic positions of\nthe top 2 economies of the US and China. Between many of the big EU\ncountries, Japan and the emergence of India, the **Macroeconomic** power\nremains distributed and will continue staying subdivided to be in a\nmultipolar state. This renders a leaderless **Macroeconomic** posture\nfor the coming decades.\n\n**Digitalization Order:** This is a very unique aspect which is not run\nby big economies but by companies, many of which have much larger market\ncapitalization than the GDP of many countries. If the companies build\nalliances with specific countries then their ability to compete in the\nglobal markets will dilute and the world will remain digitally divided\nand isolated. There is a staggering amount of world power that sits in\nthe algorithms of these companies whether they drive AI based platforms,\nsocial media platforms or healthcare based innovations. Our world cannot\nafford this subdivision to deal with the crisis that the planet will\nface from weather and virus based threats.\n\nLooking back at the **Macroeconomic** view, is it really good for the\nworld to be multipolar with a leaderless posture? I think so. Here is an\nanalogy to draw. Since we practically diluted the HQ mindset of\nSnowflake, the geographic and functional subdivisions of the company\nhave a great ability to act in independence for all of us to think and\nbuild the HQ mindset in our being. Similarly for many countries,\nchallenges of over-dependence on manufacturing, energy and technology\npowerhouses will reduce significantly.\n\nSo moving from countries, to companies and to individuals, how does this\napply to each of us? Are you super-dependent on a few people for\nintellectual and knowledge nourishments? You can craft time out to\nnourish your mind, body and intellect to become increasingly\nindependent. Do you?\n\nThoughts provoked through Courtesy of one of 2023's top 10 Ted Talks:\n\n**https://youtu.be/uiUPD-z9DTg?si=LekKXXZLlGZ66paW**\n\nAugust 13 2023\n\nIn honor of the recently celebrated 'Youth Day' (August 12th), I am\nmaking an unusual or rather brave attempt to analogically compare youth\nwith the economies.\n\nCertain economies (nations) live by the day and some think of the long\nterm and invest in the future. Fiscal spendings of many of the first\nworld countries is very high in terms of what it takes for pension\npayouts, health care of the aging population, interest on debt,\ninvestments in infrastructure and defense. All these added together are\nbig amounts representing 40%+ of the expenditures compared to the total\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product). Many of these countries have accumulated\ndebts which can be anywhere between 1.5 to 3 times their GDP.\n\nLet's draw an analogy. You as an individual generate a certain value as\na personal GDP from earnings (direct and indirect) and there is\npotentially an obligation to repay for your loans, installments to\nreturn money to your parents/families and other interest payments. Sum\nof the outstanding loans represent what you owe as a proportion of\ndues/debts compared to what you make (similar to the stated debt above).\nTotal debt usually can be a lot more compared to annual earnings and as\na result there is a big portion of your income that is used to pay\ninterest on your personal debts.\n\nRecently, one of the agencies (Fitch) downgraded the rating for the\nUnited States to AA+ from AAA. Rating is usually driven from the\ngovernment's smooth functioning, fiscal responsibilities, interest rates\n(high is bad), and debt/gdp ratio. Many factors that softly define these\nmeasures include aging population, engineering and entrepreneurism\nposture, freedom of speech, defense spending and yield on the government\nissued bonds, which determine confidence of domestic and foreign\ninvestors of the nation.\n\nThis will deviate many of the foreign economies from investing in the\ngovernment bonds to possibly making investments in ventures.\nEntrepreneurship and Innovation posture of the US still remains to be\nstrong. I have a broader view of certain disadvantages and possible\npositive outcomes for the US in a separate coverage so DM me on that\nnote if you are interested.\n\nThis one rating drop from AAA to AA+ is not going to slow the US down.\nAdditionally, there are still 9 other countries that have a AAA rating.\n\nSo similarly, what does a youth do to be resilient to the forces of\nuncertainty:\n\n-   Maintain a solid entrepreneurial posture as individual and\n    > communicate effectively\n\n-   Make long term fiscal and intellectual investments\n\n-   Youth needs to crank good stuff through innovation and focus, savage\n    > like\n\n-   Persistence is the biggest predictor of success, slay it\n\n-   25 year old who is well informed with perseverance can make really\n    > big dents, so be woke and glow up\n\n-   Be the one that leaders will venture into\n\nSo, Are you AAA? Do you have endorsements? Do you know your personal\nrating?\n\nAugust 6 2023\n\n**Technology Macros:** Then, Now and the Future\n\nAbout a decade ago, the combined Market Capitalization of Facebook\n(\\~\\$100B), Apple (\\~\\$425B), Amazon (\\$140B), Netflix (\\~\\$20B),\nMicrosoft (\\$280B) and Google (\\~\\$300B) was valued at \\~\\$1.2 Trillion.\n\nToday Meta (\\~\\$800), Apple (\\~\\$2.86T), Amazon (\\~\\$1.43T), Netflix\n(\\~\\$191B ), Microsoft (\\~\\$2.44T) and Google (\\~\\$1.62T) amass Market\nCapitalization in the order of \\~\\$9.3 Trillion.\n\nComparatively, in the last 10 years, the United States' GDP grew from\n\\$13T to \\$26.2T and India's GDP grew from \\$1.85T to \\$3.75T\n(estimated).\n\nAs you can see, the technology sector with the 6 companies in\nperspective, grew disproportionately by a factor of \\~8 compared to the\nGDP growth by a factor of \\~2. This represents 17.5% annual growth of\ntechnology businesses for 10 years in a row.\n\nIn the duration of Covid years, largely from mid of 2020 up until mid\n2022, technology and countries experienced massive boost from the free\nmoney flowing into the system through stimulus spends, quantitative\neasing and very low interest rates. Besides the super high and\nunrealistic technology valuations, this led to a surge in how crypto\ncurrencies and digital assets like NFTs were appreciated.\n\nLast 18 months changed the game. Between the Ukraine-Russia war, rising\ninflation, rising cost of fuel prices, supply chain crisis and rising\ninterest rates, the liquidity tightened significantly. As a result, as\nwitnessed, a lot of technology companies are restructuring or doing down\nrounds and the free money is going away. Many of the technology company\nvaluations, which were valued at 15-18 times the revenue in mid 2020,\nsaw a valuation drop to 3-4 times the revenue, at this point.\n\nAs we look into the future, major technology players will continue to\nprosper and possible valuations can grow to be 2.5 or 3 times in the\nnext decade (from \\$10T to \\$25T-30T). As the valuations continue to\ngrow, the players and the underlying enablement of technology platforms\nwill go through a series of changes enabled by AI, Data, Compute, Power\nEfficiency and other Platform leverages.\n\nRecently, I discussed 16 leadership development factors with my\nmanagement team. One of the key perspectives that I expect leaders (and\nall the individuals) to be aware of is '**Macro/Industry trends'**. It\nis imperative that we stay abreast of the modern technology stack, the\ndata cloud, LLM shifts, leverage of LLMs on the new data sets, impact of\ncompute (GPUs and Quantum Computing), strengthening our Security\nposture, Power Efficiencies, and evolution of Technology Macros in each\nof the Industry Verticals. These narratives will help us drive our\nstrategies, thought leadership and representation of our\nbrands/identities as individuals.\n\nWe also need to understand a **Macro** view of us as an individual, to\nknow our past, our present and the trajectory into the future. Do you?\n\nJuly 30 2023\n\n**Unionizing Superconductivity in the Tech Mix**\n\nBefore we jump into what is new this week, let's review some key\ndefinitions:\n\n**Conductors:** Those substances through which an electric current flows\nare called conductors (Copper, Aluminium and Gold) and through which an\nelectric current cannot flow are called insulators (Wood or Plastic)\n\n**Semiconductors:** Comparatively, Semiconductors used in Integrated\nCircuits are smaller, faster and cheaper alternatives used in electronic\ncircuits and conduct electricity more than glass or plastic and less\nthan Copper or Aluminium\n\n**Superconductors:** A superconductor is a material that can conduct\nelectricity with no resistance. Superconductors, unlike conductors, do\nnot release heat and do not experience any loss of electricity in\ntransit. Essentially electrons do not collide with atoms of the material\nduring the transit of power.\n\nHere is what transpired earlier this week. For the first time in world\nhistory superconductor behavior was synthesized, by research scientists\nin South Korea, at **room** temperature and at **ambient** pressure from\na modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. Why is this important?\n\n-   Past experiments indicate that Superconductors necessitated both\n    > very low temperatures and very high pressures for seamless\n    > superconductivity\n\n-   Earlier to this discovery, there was also an experiment that proved\n    > superconductivity at room temperature using hydrogen sulfide and\n    > yttrium super-hydride, however it necessitated application of\n    > tremendously high pressure for this superconductivity\n\n-   This breakthrough takes us closer to creation of magnetic field for\n    > building at scale magnetic levitation based frictionless trains,\n    > superconductor based powerful microprocessors and infinite battery\n    > storage\n\n-   Imagine how much acceleration this will provide in our respective AI\n    > journeys, Quantum Computers (which require ultra cool surroundings\n    > today to minimize impact of heat on the quantum states from being\n    > destroyed) and to never be able to charge your batteries\n\nBetween exponential accelerations in AI, Computing, Connectivity, Data\nTransfer and now Power, we will get many steps closer to dealing with\nenvironmental crisis\n\n**De-Unionizing from the Mix for Superconductivity**\n\n-   Unions were built in yesteryears to create monopoly of labor against\n    > monopoly of businesses\n\n-   Recently, many of the actors and story writers have become\n    > 'strikers' against the adoption of AI based tools.

Do you?\n\nJuly 23 2023\n\n**Science of Creating Art**\n\nEarlier last week Meta announced CM3leon (Chameleon), a\ntransformer-based autoregressive model designed for multi-modal tasks,\nspecifically for text and image generation. Let's examine in depth\n\n-   Transformer based means neural network architecture converts one\n    > input form to another. Text to Image for example\n\n-   Multi-modal in this context means supporting many modes: converting\n    > text to image, text guided image editing (example: add sunglasses\n    > to a person), or asking questions about the image (example:\n    > explain the architecture of construction shown)\n\n-   Autoregressive model predicts pixels of an image based on past\n    > pixels. CM3leon Model was trained with licensed shutterstock\n    > images and associated text data. Other models include Diffusion\n    > and GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) models\n\n-   Diffusion model creates a solid image as a mix of noise and pixels\n    > such that noise is removed one pixel at a time\n\n-   GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) model is where 2 AIs compete -\n    > one is rendering for perfection and other is determining if the\n    > image is fake till the time AI that is detecting fakeness cannot\n    > claim so anymore\n\n-   CM3leon will compete with the likes of Stable Diffusion, Dall-E\n    > (from OpenAI) and Midjourney which are other prompt & AI based\n    > image management tools\n\n**Partners in the Ecosystem**\n\nMicrosoft announced availability of Meta's OpenSource Llama 2 models\nalong with an array of offerings from Huggingface (OpenSource platform\nwith 120k models) and OpenAI's language models. If Microsoft has enabled\nOpenAI why would it enable access to Meta's LLMs?\n\nLike our datacloud, it is building a frenemy in Meta to enable increased\nusage of Azure platform where it can now **converge** LLM providers,\nNVIDIA and the Azure cloud.\n\n**Partners in our Ecosystem**\n\nAs partners in our ecosystem, we often gather leaders across functions.\nEarlier last week, our IT and finance leadership team got together for a\nteam building event. We will host our India Sales leadership team in the\nnear future at the Pune office for their H2 planning event and be able\nto co-mingle with them. There is no perspective of frenemies here - we\nare here to serve a single purpose of marching towards a \\$10B goal.\n\n**Inspiring Machines from Arts**\n\nAn artist is inspired from another artist when she creates a piece of\nart whether it is a picture, sculpture or music. A lawsuit filed against\nthe image creation AI companies did not hold its weight on the grounds\nthat why would a machine similarly not be inspired if it used art only\nfor the reference purpose.\n\n**Inspiring (Wo)men from Smarts**\n\nOften we see an individual or a leader as an artist at its best. It is\nreally okay to reference a leader's style to inspire yourself as long as\nyou do not become a stereotypical copy or a fake, in some cases to\nensure that you are not following footsteps blindly. Use all the good\nthings as a reference to hit a good next shot in your golf life. Do you?\n\nJuly 16 2023\n\nMonopoly is a situation where there are no close substitute offerings\nfor a product or a service. You saw that with Microsoft Windows, Google\nSearch, perhaps even a local electricity company or a national railway\nagency.\n\n**Differentiating and Competing with Threads**\n\nComparatively, you have Facebook, YouTube, Whatsapp, Instagram, TikTok,\nSnapChat, Pinterest, Reddit, Linked, Twitter and many others\nrepresenting a sea of offerings as **competitive** social/professional\nmedia for the individuals. To add to this wonderland, Meta recently\nannounced its Threads platform and you would wonder why.\n\n-   Twitter is working to limit number of views of its platforms in\n    > order to avoid harvesting of its data sets so it turns out to be a\n    > an opportunity for a new player\n\n-   At the same time, to be a player in the LLM game, you need a\n    > platform rich of textual (language) data which neither Facebook\n    > nor Instagram is\n\n-   Using Twitter as it competes with traditional media and enables\n    > citizen journalism, Threads will become another player\n\n-   Threads can remain more agnostic of fake news compared to the other\n    > social media platforms\n\nOf course, there is a wave of subscribers that jumped on to meet this\nnew kid on the block. Whether it offers a new **differential** value or\nnot is another question that will only be answered with time.\n\n**Differentiating and Competing with ChatGPT**\n\nSimilarly, ChatGPT had a reduced number of users and usage in the recent\npast. Has the excitement for the new kid on the block faded, are there\nmore **competitive** players and there isn't much of a **differential**\noffering or is it that given the summer holidays students who used\nOpenAI/ChatGPT, reduced the usage. ChatGPT has just about 4 Million\npaying subscribers and of these only 500,000 users use non-prompt based\ninterface to invoke API calls in OpenAI.\n\nMind you, a lot of advances in physical sciences, healthcare (creation\nof new drugs), and making software development autonomous will be some\nof the significant transformations with API based usage of the LLMs to\nprovide a **differential** value and offering. As such the number of\n'consumer' use cases will reduce while increasing the consumption in the\n'enterprise' businesses, which is a big success criteria for a software\nbusiness.\n\n**Differentiating and Competing with Self**\n\nThis raises a question as an individual: is there competition that I\ndeal with - what is my resilience to the perceived **competition**. What\nis my **differential** offering? Be like a racehorse, put the blinders\non to not look sideways and aim for your goal. Play to win like a Golf\nplayer, make your next shot better than the previous one and create a\nbetter version of you.\n\nJuly 9 2023\n\n**Creating Products in the Outer Space**\n\n[\\\"Micro-\\\" means \\\"very small.\\\" Microgravity is]{.mark} where the pull\nof gravity is not very strong[.]{.mark}\n\nA company named 'Rocket Lab' designs and builds Photon spacecraft to\nprovide power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control for\nVarda Space Industries (Another company intending to manufacturing\nproducts in the outer space) 120 kg in-space manufacturing satellite\nwhich will produce high-value products in zero-gravity and return them\nto Earth in a re-entry capsule.\n\nManufacturing in microgravity enables low cost and high precision\ncreation of\n\n-   High quality crystals which are used for drug development by\n    > pharmaceuticals industry\n\n-   Uniform high quality fibers used for Fiber Optics and\n\n-   Bioprinting 3-d structures of cells for creation of complex organs\n    > without the influence of gravity\n\n**Creating Outer Space for the Growth Mindset**\n\nDistracting gravitational forces from unnatural outlets like social\nmedia, OTT platforms or water coolers often impact personal\nproductivity. I am determined to spend at least half of my weekend for\npersonal development through watching podcasts, reading, learning new\nskills and writing objectively. Getting into microgravity enables\nastronauts to push objects that weigh in hundreds of pounds.\n\nHow do you find microgravities for your acceleration? Do you?\n\nJuly 1 2023\n\n**'Tipping' Machines that are Tipping the Physical Businesses??**\n\nWe continue seeing physical businesses that are disrupted by Robotics,\nAI, and IoT. One such thing is a fully automated robotic kitchen.\nCombining thermal sensors, IoT, AI recognizing actions and ingredients\nin chef recipes, and Robotics, these robotic chefs recreate chef's\ngourmet recipes. Many of these chefs will receive royalty for machines\nusing their recipes, like in the music industry. New recipes can also be\ncreated from machine learning of the popular recipes.\n\nIn another use case, the number of driverless cars are increasing on the\nroads especially in the Bay Area. We now see many driverless cars from\nCruise (General Motors owned) and Waymo (Google owned).\n\nAs these traditional businesses are getting tipped over by machines, are\nwe going to start tipping (\\$\\$) the machines as they provide us\nservices?\n\n**A Players**\n\nDo you ever feel that you are not learning enough at work?\n\nIt is said that we are an average of five people we spend the time with.\n\nAlso, we are now exposed to more content than ever before. Our proximal\ndevelopment is now sped up by it in addition to the people around us. We\noften feel that we need not rely on peers and leaders to learn as we can\nfind answers online when there is a question.\n\nThis element is further accelerated when you don't need to look up for\ncontent as with the Large Language Models (LLMs) the answers come to\nyou.\n\nSeparately, we should have many 'A players' around as all of you have\nbeen through a very comprehensive selection process. Being an 'A player'\nis not just being intellectually genius. It also involves the ability to\ninfluence, coach and partner with others to create outcomes, including\nleveraging the digital machines above.\n\nHere are some questions to answer, am I surrounded by 'A players and\nmachines'? Am I an 'A player'? What do you think?\n\nJune 25 2023\n\n**Outer Space and Communications**\n\nI ran into two things that made me think about our outer space. Firstly,\nthere is a 170 Foot Celestial Body on Collision Course with earth. NASA,\nthe world's premier space agency, has been closely tracking it and\npredicts that the asteroid will intersect with earth's orbit although\nthe impact probability with the earth is very low. To keep the planet\nsafe, there will be necessary intervention for diversion or other\nmeasures to deal with this celestial body.\n\nSecondly, on my flight to San Francisco, I was appreciating how we are\nable to have real-time TV streaming and high speed internet access on\nthe flights. This is made possible with the StarLink network. So what is\na StarLink network?\n\n-   This is a satellite constellation operated by SpaceX and provides\n    > coverage over 56 countries\n\n-   This includes 4,000 mass produced small satellites in Low Earth\n    > Orbit, and will possibly extend to 42,000 units over time\n\n-   This will eventually become a global mobile phone service, although\n    > it is hard to tell if this replaces our existing on the ground\n    > mobile networks. Just think about how our landlines got disrupted\n    > in the first place\n\n-   These satellites probably create a lot of clutter that interfere\n    > with astronomy. As a result, SpaceX is implementing upgrades to\n    > StarLink satellites by reducing their brightness during operation.\n\n-   Similar to addressing concerns from the 170 foot asteroid, these\n    > satellites will de-orbit at the end of their life and will avoid\n    > collisions based on tracking data\n\n**Communicating your Inner Space**\n\nRecent visit of Narendra Modi, India's Prime Minister, to the United\nStates is a solid representation of Symbolism and Status. Symbolism\ncommunicates the brand of this relationship and the success is defined\nin the narrative through joint commitment between the two nations on\ntopics like Jet engine design, semiconductor production, combined work\non AI/ quantum computing platforms and other trade commitments for\naerospace and defense.\n\nMeasure of your personal brand is a function of how you symbolize your\nbrand presence through awesomeness, body language, communications and\ndapper (remember these ABCDs). This certainly needs to be complimented\nby your content. Value narratives of your work products combined with\nhow you stylize these representations with your finesse makes your brand\nholistic.\n\n**Responding to a Snafu**\n\nAs I was watching the live stream of BBC news on my flight, I came\nacross yet another topic. A BBC reporter was providing coverage on\nGlastonbury music festival talking about Elton John, Arctic Monkey, Guns\nN' Roses and others. A watcher possibly under the influence of certain\nsubstances walks into the conversation and uses profanity. Both the BBC\nreported and the show host immediately were not stunned, remained calm\nand apologized even though what transpired was not in their control.\n\nDo you symbolize your brand with narratives and dapper? Do you keep calm\nafter a snafu and recover ground?\n\nJune 18 2023\n\n**'Agility vs Value' of a Work Product**\n\nLet's examine two roles of Program Management vs Product Management, as\nwe think about this topic. A Program Manager manages multiple\ninitiatives with a focus on planning, resources, risks, communications,\ninterdependencies, strategic thinking and alignment of these\ninitiatives. A Product Manager focuses on delivering products for\nrevenue growth keeping in mind customer's needs, market research data,\nand product vision while collaborating with engineering, design and\nmarketing functions.\n\nIn a nutshell Program lifecycle is all about agility and delivery focus\nand Product delivery is all about the value and growth focus. It does\nnot mean one arm need not know of the other.\n\nSimilarly, individuals need to focus on creating value at a very high\nspeed. Sooner you draw this balance to ensure agility of a program\nmanager and value orientation of the products you create, your need to\nget guidance and coaching to do your job will reduce significantly. This\nimplicit mindset in your thought fabric will drive for superlative\noutcomes for a long term.\n\n**Moving from Value to Savings**\n\nHave you ever thought of what happens to your PF contributions? About\n45% of funds are invested in government securities and 55% in other\nfixed income securities through public sector and private companies. Up\nto 15% of the funds can also be invested in equities through Exchange\nTraded Funds (ETFs). Each of these investment opportunities compound\nyour contribution to make a big payout eventually.\n\nAs projected, Social security funds (equivalent to pension or PF funds\nin India) in the US will be depleted in 2034 as the government\nconstantly spends more on the payout than what it makes from\ncontributions and other sources of income.\n\nWhat happens when investment strategies fail and the governments are\nunable to pay recurring or one time pension payments back to its\ncitizens. Sometimes this leads to a combination of increase in taxes\ncollected, printing more currencies (quantitative easing) and\nintroducing austerity measures.\n\nEconomies and GDPs (Gross Domestic Product) of nations grow based on\nmany factors including political stability and investments in\ninfrastructure, education, and technologies. Look around and you will be\nable to pinpoint nations where economies will flourish or decline.\n\nI am looking forward to announcing our Snowvation winners shortly. Hope\nto see you all at the India All Hands meeting on Thursday.\n\nJune 11 2023\n\n**Displacement of Traditional Businesses**\n\nIf you recall when Uber (and Ola) started, they introduced application\nbased taxi rides booking from the convenience of your handheld devices.\nAlthough it did displace the 'haul a taxi' business. Similarly AirBnB\ndiluted the hospitality business and WeWork diluted some of the\ncommercial real estate business providing more convenience and\nflexibility with technology as a medium.\n\n**What happens when Tech Businesses and Governments Intersect**\n\nAs I write this, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United\nStates is challenging the operating model of the Crypto exchanges for\ncompanies like Coinbase and Binance. They are challenging that 13 assets\nwith Coinbase and 12 with Binance are being traded as securities that\nare not registered. Understand that Crypto Currencies are not regulated\nin most of the large economies and this leads to a conflict between the\ngovernment agencies and crypto companies. Let's understand some more:\n\n-   Currencies like US Dollar, Euro to Rupee which are regulated by the\n    > governments are called as Fiat Currencies\n\n-   Crypto-currencies are traded as block chain enabled ledger driven\n    > digital currencies\n\n-   Companies like CoinBase, Binance, and FTX (liquidated now) are\n    > global trading exchanges that enable conversion of Fiat to Crypto\n    > currencies and vice versa\n\n-   Fees paid for the conversion of the currencies are called as gas\n    > fees\n\n-   These exchanges are not regulated by a specific government as they\n    > are global and technological in nature\n\n-   FTX went bankrupt as they fraudulently leveraged the crypto deposits\n    > of their customers leading to massive losses. A classic outcome of\n    > an unregulated business model\n\n-   The same SEC that allowed for CoinBase's IPO is now leading a\n    > process to irregularize crypto exchanges pushing these companies\n    > to move away geographically and then to IP (as in network) gate\n    > and block citizens from trading in Crypto\n\nThis is an outcome of a situation when technology intersects the\ngovernments and its proceedings. Impact on AI tech whether it is LLMs or\nother relevant AI tech is yet to be seen as this will also disrupt\neconomies. Impacts of employment and associated tax revenues are hard to\npredict as governments are still putting their arms around what is\ntriggering with the LLMs. In both cases of AI and Crypto the technology\nmoves/moved much faster than how quickly the governments react.\n\n**What must the governments do?**\n\nThis necessitates that governments also lead the technology adoption in\nparallel or in advance where applicable. Look at how UPI like\ntransactions and the implementation of digital currencies by some\ncountries will lead a new transformation. Will this possibly accelerate\nde-dollarization? Only time will tell.\n\nNext week I will touch upon the Agility and Value of work delivered\nwhich I was hoping to write this time. However, the above thoughts\nalready gave a very detailed write-up. If you would like to hear about a\ntopic of your interest DM me and I will try my best to write something.\n\nEnjoy the new week.\n\nJune 4 2023\n\nEarlier in April this year, I started sharing my learnings with my\ndirect leadership team and coined it as 'Sunday Thoughts'. I am\nexpanding the outreach after receiving some input to share with the\nlarger audience.\n\n**Where is AI?**\n\nA lot has transpired with Generative AI this year, which has been a key\ntopic of interest for me along with macroeconomics, geopolitics and our\nbeloved Data Cloud. AI coin has two sides like anything else: one that\nwill probably reshape and displace jobs/industries and another side that\nwill stand up to beat the next pandemic, climate crisis, energy\nchallenges and asteroids. We need to embrace AI through constant\neducation and awareness.\n\nMore than a decade ago, I was introduced to terms like SDDC (Software\nDefined Data Center) and SD-WAN (Software Defined Wide Area Network).\nVirtual Machines enabled Software Defined Data Centers where these\nlogical machines were connected over Software Defined Network. We are\nseeing a lot more activities in Software and Hardware driven AI\ncapabilities.\n\nRecently, there were major announcements about the **NVIDIA Omniverse™\nAvatar Cloud Engine (ACE)**. Let's examine this a bit more by reviewing\na few terms.\n\n**Universe:** All of the space along with time context represent our\nuniverse (Uni for one)\n\n**Multiverse:** Multiple universes exist in a multiverse (parallel),\nbeyond our observable universe (Multi for many)\n\n**Omniverse:** Collection of every single universe, including\nmultiverses represent Omniverse (Omni for All inclusive)\n\n**Metaverse:** This is an immersive virtual world which facilitated by\nVirtual Reality (hence Meta)\n\nNow imagine, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine where Metaverse meets\nAI. This as I understand is a single, shared, immersive, persistent, 3D\nvirtual space where humans experience life in ways they could not in the\nphysical world. Imagine physical factories for Chips (ICs), Batteries,\nElectric Vehicles and others are virtualized/digitalized in an immersive\nplatform, they are now redesigned and improved in the NVIDIA Omniverse\nACE before the actual physical factories are changed. I am personally\nexcited to hear more about this at our Summit where we will have Frank\nSlootman speak with Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA. Hopefully there\nis further intersection of our Data Cloud in this Metaverse at some\npoint.\n\nAnother topic on the leadership styles to review is the **'HIPPO\nEffect'**. The HIPPO effect describes a cognitive bias according to\nwhich the opinion of the highest paid person receives more attention. We\nall deal with this situation many times and our leadership posture of\ngoing (being) direct will make an oxymoron out of this context. I\nencourage you all to not build a bigger HIPPO out of the leaders that\nyou interact with. This would mean that you need to find the **right\nplace and right time** to provide thoughts and inputs for you to be\nheard. Don't be a yes (wo)man and figure out a way to share your\nperspectives and don't use the watercooler to share your thoughts, go to\nthe source.\n\nHave you seen a Hippo? Are you one?\n\nMay 28 2023\n\nDo you realize how a lot of us stopped watching television news or even\nreading newspaper news?\n\nWe have moved for news to be real-time, sent to us (compared to us\ngetting to it), and to become independent of traditional media houses.\nOne such change is evident on Twitter spaces. Recently, Ron Desantis and\nElon Musk discussed prior's US presidential candidature on 'Twitter\nspace', platform to engage in live audio conversations on Twitter. Many\nof the traditional media houses cried wolf and botched on a 20 minute\ndelay in this engagement.\n\nBetween direct to citizen interactions encouraging citizen journalism,\ncreating break-out rooms and real-time tech enabled streaming,\ntraditional news media is challenged and changed. This trend will soon\nfollow in other geographies, my prediction, including India where the\naccess to smartphones and inexpensive data plans is also changing the\ngame.\n\nOn a separate note, the startup game in major technology hubs is\nbecoming a tale of 2 cities: this is a great time for AI based startups\nand for other pre-AI/pre-bubble burst startups to shut shop unless they\nare making revenues that far exceed their current investments. New\ninvestments are still a function of a dream and the energy levels of the\nfounder.\n\nSpeaking about energy levels of a founder, did you know Musk offered to\nsell Tesla to Apple in 2018 when its valuation was hovering around \\$60B\nto where it is now at \\$600B+ today?\n\nLastly, I made some notes from Frank's commentary at the all hands\n\n-   Twitter head count reduced from 7,500 to 1,800 and it still performs\n    > superiorly\n\n-   For all of us as leaders to be close to the action and take charge\n    > inside the Data Cloud\n\n-   For a consumption centric revenue mode, our forecast dropped by\n    > \\$100M for 3.8% downgrade in revenue and valuation took a\n    > rollercoaster ride\n\n-   Don't get to obsessed with your job titles/labels, just come and\n    > work together (Don't create an identity crisis from self-created\n    > expectations is my read)\n\n-   Talk to everyone, ask questions and operate through influence - the\n    > world takes note of this\n\n-   Don't pull your badge out ever\n\n-   When you feel objected, unpack the objection and go to the lowest\n    > atomic level to gain clarity and resolution (primarily, this came\n    > up as a response for sales cycle although this applies to all of\n    > us)\n\nHappy learning as we unpack a new week\n\nMay 21 2023\n\nThere was a congressional hearing in the United States last week to\nappreciate the perils and the boons of AI. Congressmen/women interacted\nwith Sam Altman, founder open AI, prof. Gary Marcus and Christina\nMontgomery, Chief Privacy and Trust officer at IBM.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n-   AI is not new but it is certainly having a moment right now\n\n-   Composure demonstrated by these leaders was very profound,\n    > relatively more open/engaging and humanly, compared to prior\n    > technology hearings\n\n-   There is a realization that we may have acted slowly with Social\n    > Media to have massive organizations created and to have witnessed\n    > many manipulations with the Social Media\n\n-   There was a consideration to create both national and international\n    > agencies to regulate use of the LLMs (Large Language Models)\n\n-   Europe was ahead with Social Media and is also relatively ahead of\n    > restricting the use of LLMs in geography. They also have presented\n    > some version of AI regulation\n\n-   Open AI model chatGPT 4.0 and subsequent ones will not be trained on\n    > consumer data, which is a good thing\n\n-   At this point in time, the LLMs are not validating the use cases for\n    > copyrights and patents. For example, I asked chatGPT to create\n    > lyrics in hindi for a love song mimicking Javed Akhtar's work\n    > style. Bingo - it did so for me. What the heck?\n\n-   At present there are many websites that are entirely created by AI\n    > bots. There is a fundamental difference between reproducing and\n    > generating content, as reproduction may have copyright and patent\n    > infringements\n\n-   As hard as it sounds, there is at least a mindset for governments,\n    > public companies and scientists to work together in this forum.\n    > Thoughts are around management of access, creation of right use\n    > cases, moderation of models for culture and language inclusivity,\n    > and managing to use AI for progressive use cases\n\n-   The hard part is a lot of the smaller LLMs can also run on the edge\n    > nodes which will make the whole process of regulations very hard\n\nMy aim is to remain engaged, appreciate the apprehensions and look for\nbuilding effective use cases, learn prompt engineering and use of models\nwith real-time data sets\n\nMay 14 2023\n\nWe figured that big companies grew organically and inorganically with\nstrategic adjacency. Let's understand aggregation, bundling and\nunbundling effects for them.\n\nPlatform aggregators enable businesses through convergence of end users,\nthird party app builders and the platform itself. A few mentions on that\nnote:\n\n-   Apple, us as consumers and companies that build applications on\n    > AppStore\n\n-   Google with YouTube as one of its platform, video publishers and\n    > YouTube subscribers\n\n-   Facebook for social media, eBay and Craigslist as marketplaces to\n    > buy/sell goods and services\n\nApp builders and service providers are under constant pressure from\nterms and conditions of the platform providers. This has led to several\nnew businesses created from unbundling opportunities.\n\nHere are some examples of new businesses created from unbundling of\naggregators capabilities\n\n-   AirBnB for leasing your property for the short term\n\n-   Reddit as a sophisticated discussion form\n\n-   Zillow and Redfin as real estate buy/sell. There are equivalent\n    > companies in India\n\n-   Tinder and Bumble for relationships\n\nIn totality the digital markets continue to grow, in many cases market\nshare (and valuation possibly) of the aggregators dilutes. Sometimes the\noffshoot companies become bigger than aggregators. Take AirBnB and\nZillow (Real Estate) for example.\n\nWe continue to grow through aggregation though in the confinement of the\ndata platform and there are offshoot companies for data cataloging, data\nquality, visualization and a lot more.\n\nNew businesses will continue to evolve from continuous aggregation and\nunbundling effects. AI will accelerate this process.\n\nWriting this note during rETL of my travel as I come back to post my US\nUx score across the hemisphere. You will see this note as soon as\nAirflow orchestration pushes my workflow on slack. Ha ha, Data lifecycle\npersonified. See you soon\n\nMay 7 2023\n\nHow much organic (home grown) disruptive innovation have you seen from\nlarge technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and\nApple in the recent years. Not much as far as I can tell. Apple created\niPhone in 2007, Google core search in late 90s, Google Maps in early\n2000s, AWS has been around for a long while and Microsoft at best\ncreated Windows in 90s. Most growth has come from acquisitions and these\ncompanies have become large technology conglomerates as a result.\n\nGoogle announced \\$70B worth shares buy back from \\$115B of its cash\nreserves. Microsoft has executed a lot of share buy back in earlier\nyears. Meta bought back \\$40B worth of shares.\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\n-   Valuations are low enough for these companies to benefit from\n    > invested in self\n\n-   It is very hard to make foundational platform changes in these\n    > companies\n\n-   They are transitioning to being cash cows from main product lines\n    > that have worked so well\n\n-   Many of them have announced staff reductions to maintain high levels\n    > of profitability\n\n-   If you followed Microsoft and Google historically, there have been\n    > so many regulatory interventions for anti-trust which discourages\n    > deployment of capitals in competitive or adjacent capabilities\n\n-   Meta has had an upshot in its valuations by 90% from this financial\n    > engineering\n\nWhere is Snowflake? We announced a buy back of \\$2B from \\$4B (Jan '23)\ncash on hand. One thing that makes us different as a tech company is\nthat we are not a tech conglomerate yet, still a singular platform and\nwe continue to innovate. Our growth is both organic and inorganic\nthrough acquisitions, still within the conformity of our platform. Do\nyou remember from Frank's note that we are a platform and not a tool?\n\nUS - Sub 1% growth of recession - Jarome Powell\n\nIn response for the us govt and fed - Cut spending, keep energy cost\nlow, -\n\nInflation =\\> function of money supply over amount of goods and\nservices; QE gave us more money and not having enough supplies leads to\ninflationary situations\n\nRecord low people coming into the company; domestic citizens don't want\nto do regular jobs; -\n\nCool of job market, cool of unemployment\n\nApril 30 2023\n\nSequoia Capital, US based early venture fund with \\$85B in assets\ninvested \\$21M in a firm named, **Harvey.Ai**. If you have watched\n'Suites' you can imagine what the intersection of AI and Harvey can look\nlike. Good lawyers in the US cost \\$800/hour and imagine that now a lot\nof their work can be done by AI tools.\n\nLikes of Harvey.Ai will offer legal services at a discounted rates,\nperhaps 30-40% lower. This will also mean that good non-tech law firms\nnow have the opportunity to use these tools and provide 30-40% discounts\nby augmenting AI capabilities.\n\nOrganizations, largely, as we look ahead will have an opportunity to\nincrease efficiencies by 30-40% or reduce costs by 30-40%, perhaps\nsomething in between.\n\nLet's go back in time. Imagine when MS Office was launched and we all\nstarted using capabilities at some point in time. We would all have been\nunemployed today if we had not figured out how to use MS Office in the\nmeantime.\n\nAI offers the same opportunity to all of us, technology enthusiasts or\nnot. You choose to use it and you can be 30% more productive, although\nlet's differentiate between efficient and productive here. Efficiency\nmeans you will do the same task in 70% of the time and productivity\nmeans you can produce 1.3x in the time spent. Organizations can\ndifferentiate between the two.\n\nIt is that time to take a leap of faith into the future, embrace AI and\nmake a transition. Curate independently, Use AI to Improvise and take\nthe outcomes of AI to Authenticate with your midas touch.\n\nHave you taken the plunge yet?"

    "content": "**\n\nHappy New Year to all. Let's get ready to ring in the new. A lot is\ngoing on in the world as we wrap 2023 and here is yet another global\nconflict in a nutshell.\n\n**Expansion of the Middle East saga**\n\nThe Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting\nthe Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez. Suez\ncanal enables passage of more than 1,500 cargo ships every month,\nprimarily Chinese container ships moving towards Europe and the United\nStates.\n\nTo the east of the Suez canal are Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The Houthis\nemerged in the 1990s as a Zaidi Shia Muslim armed insurgency group\nprimarily in northern Yemen. They represent a significant but unclear\nportion of Yemen\\'s population.\n\nAs a revenge response to Israel's military campaign in Gaza, Houthis,\nwith a likely sponsorship from Palestine supporting nations, recently\nstarted attacking commercial ships in the Suez canal with drones and\nmissiles.\n\nThis has not only disrupted the trade routes but also risked the cargo\nand the lives of the crew on board of the freight ships. This has\nalarmed the US, the UK, Canada, France and other countries to raise\ntheir guards to protect the commerce.\n\n**Impact from this War**\n\nThis has increased the insurance cost for these vessels and the ships\nare now diverted to go from Cape Cod in South Africa, resulting in a 20%\nincrease in time taken and has dampened the commerce.\n\nSaudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar intend to make the most out of their\nnatural gas in the upcoming decades to build the future of their\ncountries. The US has backed the Saudis in their war against the\nHouthis.\n\nThis also further impacts China's already marginalized economy and\nlimits their ability to supply goods to the Western world. Europeans\nwill pay a bigger price for the products causing inflationary effects.\nRemember, Russia is also a supplier of commodities and will be adversely\nimpacted.\n\n**What can happen as a result?**\n\nHouthis will not stop their attacks unless Israel stops and Israel will\nnot stop till Hamas is eliminated. This can plausibly lead to a larger\nwar beyond Israelis, Palestinians, Houthis and Saudi.\n\nThe cost of the war is also asymmetrical in that the drones that attack\nthe cargo ships cost in the order of thousands and the missiles that\ndefend them cost in Millions of dollars.\n\nAir Freight is not an option either. A container ship can carry 10,000\n40 Feet containers compared to 7 40 Feet containers that fit in a 747,\nwhich is one of the largest cargo planes.\n\nYet again, similar to the China and Taiwan conflict that I wrote about,\nDiplomacy needs to prevail here. A lot is going on. If you would like to\ncatch a glimpse of all that I read and watched over the holidays then\ndrop me a note.\n\n**"

    "content": "**\n\nGenerative AI was a hot topic for the investors in 2023 and will remain\nto be so in 2024. Here is a plunge.\n\nBefore we start with AI, let's look back about 80 years before today. We\nfigured out how to harness controlled nuclear fission in the 1940s. Two\nopportunities came out of it: for generation of energy from nuclear\nplants and for building nuclear weapons. North Korea has many nuclear\nweapons today but no nuclear power generation plant. Japan, the only\ncountry against which nuclear weapons were used, has many nuclear power\ngeneration plants with zero nuclear weapon footprint.\n\n**Noteworthy Impacts of Generative AI**\n\nSimilar to Nuclear fission, AI also has both the dimensions of growth\nacceleration and harm to humanity. Technology for years has created\ninequality in wealth. AI will not be dissimilar.\n\nAlthough long term productivity consequences of GenAI are still somewhat\nuncertain, here are some noteworthy gains\n\n-   AI has accelerated software development, healthcare, creative,\n    > education, legal and customer support businesses to name a few.\n    > There is and will be a definite impact on the labor market with\n    > these changes\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   Cost of services will decrease and the sophistication will increase\n    > for these impacted industries.

AI can create\n    > hallucinations. AI should be used as a guide or a supplement as a\n    > result, and not an authority\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   We will need to increase our security posture to defend against\n    > vulnerabilities from cyber attacks\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   There are already conflicts that arise from LLM leverage of content\n    > from media companies (refer to New York Times vs. OpenAI lawsuit)\n\nOf course, a lot of jobs will shift to increase demands in food service,\ncleaning industries, physical security, entertainment and others.\nHowever, these will not be high paying in line with my earlier remark\nabout disproportionality of wealth distribution.\n\n**OpenAI's Valuation**\n\nEstimates say that OpenAI is valued over \\$100B and Microsoft has made a\ngreat investment as a result. Is the value justified? Let's examine some\nmore.\n\n-   Currently there are many Large Language Models to choose from with\n    > both suppliers, model sizes and controlled access for data privacy\n    > in perspective\n\n-   LLMs, largely OpenAI, make money from consumers who have\n    > subscriptions and from enterprises that use LLMs similar to AWS\n    > infrastructure\n\n-   Actual cost of using millions of tokens in LLMs is still prohibitive\n\n-   Latency from AI tools today is still very high to build production\n    > ready code\n\n-   External API calls from LLMs take easily more than 10 seconds for\n    > handshakes and data exchanges, which is relatively inconvenient\n    > and unaffordable impacting user experience\n\n-   Existing LLM based startups are over-valued\n\nThis leads to many questions and some that come to my mind are: Do you\nsee more pros and cons from Generative AI? Do you have an opinion on\nOpenAI's valuation? Do you believe governments will need to move towards\nUBI (Universal Basic Income) for the welfare of its citizens?\n\n**"

    },
    "inCurriculum": true,
    "content": "High Performing & Trustworthy Culture\n\nThis article is in response to a request to share how leaders enthuse trust while building high performing teams. Think of two simple dimensions: Trust and Performance. A rockstar employee demonstrates high trust and performs superiorly. If there is a non-trustworthy employee who is not performing then he or she will find it hard to survive over a period of time. Non-trustworthy high performing individuals can be equally dangerous, or more so, as they will build a non-coherent workplace for others around them.\n\nIt is easy to understand these pockets at a high level. However to establish a culture that builds consistently high performing organizations requires the whole village to play the orchestra.\n\nFactors that Build Trust\n\nHere are a few things that come to my mind:\n\n1.  Communication: Successful organizations thrive on real-time and face-to-face (in person or virtual) conversations. This is a dialog and not a monologue from a manager to an employee. It needs to be engaging and must happen as close as possible around the event. This necessitates privacy, sensitivity and mutual respect in both directions. It is everyone's responsibility to initiate these dialogs whether you are an employee or a manager.\n\n2.  Respect: Building a culture of objective and honest dialogs is the next level. Always, keep the issues in perspective and not the individuals. Most of us go through an intense recruitment cycle being an employee or if you apply the same mindset to your personal relationships outside your family then they also go through intensive evaluations over a period of time to be that special someone. You are where/who you are for a reason.\n\n3.  Integrity: Confidentiality of conversations is extremely important. Coming back to keeping the issue and person separated, sometimes it necessitates leaders to share the origin, outcomes and fix of issues with the larger organization without naming/shaming any individuals. Leaders need to be effective listeners in these situations or otherwise, as listening is a much harder skill to develop for most humans.\n\n4.  Support: Providing guidance, tools, navigation path and adequate time for people to be successful is essential. The world around us changes constantly and the methods/tools of yesterday become irrelevant over time. As a result, for a leader, it is extremely important to be cognizant that without an adequate development plan neither the organization nor she can be successful.\n\n5.  Feedback: It is important to let individuals know where they stand and what improvements are required. Providing and accepting critical feedback is important to all of us as an individual or a leader. Ensure that this dialog happens in a very comfortable environment, as often as required, non-toxically and in both directions.\n\nHigh Performing Organizations\n\nAssuming that we all understand our role in building our trust with others and the larger organization, here are some key questions we must look at to build a high performing organization\n\n1.  Initiative: Are you thinking outside the box? Do you understand the real impacts of your goals? Are you constantly challenging yourself to drive value from your outcomes? Do you understand if your goals connect to the larger goals of the organization?\n\n2.  Adaptability: What are your stimuli like to the changing narrative of the world around you? Our life is constantly changing, especially within the organizational context of how many exponential changes happen in this world.\n\n3.  Reliability: How do I demonstrate high quality, super-responsive and dependability traits?\n\n4.  Collaboration: Most individuals, owing to an implicit competitive mindset, find it difficult to work with peers. High performing organizations thrive to score more than 2 from adding 1 to a 1. 10x thinking can happen in your dreambox however 10x outcomes do not come from individuals. Do you collaborate with others?\n\n5.  Initiative: This is my favorite point of view. How do I find new ways for getting things done? Do I play the 10x productivity game? Do I find ways to optimize productivity? Do I share my best practices with others?\n\nIn the performance part I ask many questions for personal introspection.\n\nA few techniques for continuous engagement and learning\n\n1.  Connecting with Leaders: Powerful and influential people don't have time. If you get an hour with them then make the best use of every minute. If your conversation with this person becomes boring to her then you have lost their attention. Being a powerful leader, he/she should also build tolerance to enjoy the boring conversations.\n\n2.  Social Skills: A friend on social/professional media can be unfriended. You can't unfriend a noisy neighbor or even a manager/colleague for that matter. If there is a noisy neighbor (or even a manager) you will need skills to walk into your neighbor's house with a cake to build a relationship and then address the noise issue. We have to constantly uplevel/upgrade our human skills, just like your smartphone or the apps on the device.\n\n3.  Dealing with Unlike mindedness: Social media's AI engine and watercooler at the office will build natural affinity to your liking for the content or the people you interact with. Real workplaces are not designed like social media to put you in a loop of likings so you will need an open mind to build an open door culture.\n\n4.  Humility: Humility is an enduring quality required especially for the accomplished bunch. You need to stop being the center of the world and think about the collective humility of your ecosystem.\n\n5.  Self-Development: In the decade prior to right now, you could always predict what the world of employment (or livelihood) looked like for the upcoming 20-30 years with learning and academia in perspective. This is not true today and it necessitates learning and retraining all the time.\n\n  Few decades back, imagine if a tractor replaced you on your farm, you could figure out what it would be like to be employed in a tractor manufacturing facility. This was a relatively low skill transition. This is not the case today. New jobs in arts, in creative fields and science streams require superior skills.\n\n  If you look back in time, global inequalities have significantly reduced in the last few decades. With the rapid changes in the skills and technology landscape, there will be a burst of changes that will increase these inequalities. Opportunities will have significant gaps to address based on an individual's phase (middle-age vs. early in career talent), geography (knowledge/opportunities availability) and skill transition differentials (factory worker vs. knowledge worker)\n\nTake some time out to ask yourself the questions for a high performing organization and introspect. Do you have other factors that broaden these thoughts? Do you have best practices/examples to share? Do you see (y)our organization and think differently? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, as always.\n\nFew of the thoughts came from this dialog with Yuval Noah Harari (Author of the Sapiens, Homo Deus, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9qLHEaZNzbM?si=TsMU2sa8qzJUZ_eQ"

She was helping with the catering and had been there for\ntwo years. To my surprise, she moved there from Andaman and Nicobar\nIslands, which is quite rare. She seemed to have some problems with her\nfamily situation, also possibly with the city and was planning to move\nback to the islands. This conversation happened in less than a minute.\nThis made me wonder what it takes to be in a big city, especially a big\nHi-Tech Metro in a country like India.\n\nI spent two days in the city of Bangalore, attending an event. Hotel was\nabout 15 minutes walking distance from the convention center. When I was\nwalking on the sidewalk, a motorcycle rider went past me on the\nsidewalk, at a very high speed of about 40 km/h, as the roads were busy.\nThese riders often use the sidewalk to ride during the peak hours. I\nhave seen this behavior in the cities of Mumbai and Pune as well.\n\nCrossing the road in Bangalore was an adventure in itself. Nobody\nstopped for the pedestrians to cross the road. When you have about half\na dozen other walking citizens, one of them musters the courage to start\nwalking through the high speeding traffic and the other citizens join\nhim or her. As crazy as it sounds, eventually life works out.\n\nThe Facade\n\nAt the event, addressing the leaders of the high-tech technology\ncompanies a bureaucrat representing the state of Karnataka started\nselling all the greatness the geography has to offer. Great weather,\naccess to existing successful companies, academia, talent and the great\neconomic progress that the state has made.\n\nThe bureaucrat failed to address the massive challenges with traffic and\nthe severe lack of infrastructure.\n\nAll of us try to present the opportunity while greatly hiding the\nunderlying problems. This is not unique to one individual, a division, a\ncompany or a city/state. This is not a criticism for one state over the\nother but it makes me wonder how we as a bureaucrat or an employee of a\nmultinational company change our mindset. For a moment, we are on the\nbusy roads of the third world and quickly switch gears to the first\nworld as soon as the air conditioning at the office kicks in.\n\nCheck Points in a Global Environment\n\nTo build a corollary and to understand the blind spots, let's examine a\nfew data points:\n\nWhen I picked my current job at Snowflake, it did not have a well\ndefined perspective on what the role entailed as we were in a formative\nstate of the company and of the geography.\n\n-   What was expected? At first, it was imperative to understand the\n    > expectations. We built the geography as an arbitrage for talent\n    > availability and cost management. We had to have clarity in how we\n    > would build talent through academia and lateral hiring, while\n    > leveraging our personal network for referrals\n\n-   Workplace: Clear mandate was to ensure that we built a world class\n    > work environment that would be equal to or better than our global\n    > offices. So, as stated above, we brought in the first world air\n    > conditioning to the office (pun intended)\n\n-   Exposing the World here to the World there: In all the years, with\n    > Snowflake and prior to that, we have encouraged the visitors to\n    > take the bus with our employees so that they can see the speeding\n    > riders on the sidewalk (pun intended, again). In their latest\n    > visit our leadership agreed to cancel their plane travel and took\n    > the highway to travel from Mumbai to Pune and enjoy eating Vada\n    > Pav on the way.

How do you communicate honestly? How\ndo you maintain consistency to be in the same world inside and outside\nthe workplace? Are there gotchas you would like to share?\n\nJune 02, 2024\n\nQuantum for Solace\n\nLast week somewhere in the write-up I mentioned about the need for our\nplanet to cool down by 1.7 degrees within the next two decades. We\ndesperately need a 'Quantum' for Solace. Here is a drill down.\n\nDefining Quantum Computers\n\nOur computers today, the servers, the laptops and the smartphones are\nbuilt on bits (binary digits that are either a 0 or a 1). Quantum\nComputers are built on Qubits which can be zero or one simultaneously, a\nbasic feature of a quantum computer.\n\nSuperposition: The state of being zero or one simultaneously is called\nsuperposition.\n\nEntanglement: These qubits can entangle with each other which allow\nquantum computers to grow exponentially. 2 Qubits can store and process\n4 bits, 3 to 8, 4 to 16 and so on. This exponential scaling makes\nquantum computers far more powerful than traditional computers. In our\ncomputers today, you provide input data in binary (digital) format to\nprocess data and generate outputs based on certain algorithms. In a\nquantum computer, the input is provided in the form of qubits that can\ninteract with one another. Leveraging Superposition (to be 0 or 1\nsimultaneously) and Entanglement of Qubits allows Quantum Computer to\ncarry many calculations simultaneously making it very powerful. Largest\nquantum computer today can compute on 1,225 qubits and can represent\n2\\^1225 states simultaneously.\n\nSo what? Compared to classical Supercomputer capabilities which can\npredict weather or do large scale machine learning, to avert greenhouse\neffect crisis on the planet and deeply impact the molecular structures\nfor drug discovery, significantly increasing agricultural yield quantum\ncomputers will be the key.\n\nRace for the Survival of (Wo)mankind: Building a fault tolerant quantum\ncomputer is still a slow process and it is expected that we must reduce\nglobal warming between 1.7°C and 1.8°C by 2050 to avoid catastrophic\nclimate changes. The challenge with the existing quantum computers is\nthat compared to 1,225 qubits in the largest machines we need millions\nof qubits to interact and without volatility (inaccuracy and\nunreliability). Also the power and cooling requirements for quantum\ncomputers today are cost prohibitive.\n\nIncreased carbon levels enhance the greenhouse effect, causing more\nextreme weather, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and\nhuman societies. At 422 parts per million in the atmosphere (0.0422%),\ncarbon presence is at the highest level in millions of years. Becoming\ncarbon neutral without increasing the carbon footprint is a key to\naddress the challenges arising from global warming.\n\nHow can quantum computing help?\n\n-   Quantum Computers can help improve the chemistry of batteries to\n    > improve energy density of batteries, to identify replacement\n    > materials for the composition of batteries and significantly\n    > reduce the cost of grid scale storage of solar plants. Imagine\n    > cost and power efficiencies for both the solar plants and the\n    > batteries through this improvisation\n\n-   Did you know that a lot of Carbon Dioxide emissions are from\n    > manufacturing of cement, a quintessential commodity in the\n    > construction business. Study of materials and process involved in\n    > the cement manufacturing is a great candidate for Quantum\n    > Computing leverage\n\n-   Green Hydrogen, great potential to replace fossil fuel, costs 60%\n    > more than natural gas. Quantum can help introduce pulsing to\n    > efficiently split water (H2O) into green Hydrogen and Oxygen.\n\nThere are many many more value propositions from the build out of a\nscaled Quantum machine.\n\nAre the definitions of Superpositions and entanglement as introduction\nof Quantum Computing too hard to process compared to all that is going\non in the AI/ML/LLM worlds? Yes, Indeed this is hard for laymen to\nprocess.\n\nJust know that Albert Einstein had difficulties accepting some aspects\nof quantum physics. Despite his role in its early development, he was\ntroubled by its inherent randomness and lack of determinism, famously\nstating, \\\"God does not play dice with the universe.\\\"\n\nMay 26th, 2024\n\nLife as it exists and as it existed\n\nMost Sunday mornings Nikhil, our finance leader, goes to bring a\ndelicious misal for his family. This misal at\n[Shrikrishna](https://map.sahapedia.org/article/Shrikrishna-Bhuvan/2785)\nhas batata bhaaji (spiced potato mixture), cooked pohe (flattened rice),\npohe chiwda (a savoury snack mix), and shev (gram flour noodles) topped\nwith onions and coriander (cilantro). Yummy, right? There is a caveat\nthough - the restaurant does not pack it for him unless he brings with\nhim a container along. He carries a stainless steel container to bring\nthe gravy back.\n\nSimilarly, you may have seen a lot of supermarkets around the world that\nhave containers filled with nuts and grains. You pack as much you would\nlike in a bag that you may carry along. Gen Xers and Babyboomers\nactually experienced this phenomenon at grocery stores as the primary\nmechanism.\n\nLet's also add to this context the prevalence of khadi (traditional\nhomespun cotton cloth), eating homemade ghee, yogurt and many more\norganic creations.\n\nEverything that we make is made from the resources on the planet and\nsent back to the planet - so what corrupts the planet? I am not an\nexpert on this topic however one thing that has bothered me for a while\nis the context for this write-up: Microplastics.\n\nSome Definitions\n\nPlastic Making: Plastic is made by extracting petrochemical oils and\nnatural gas from the earth as a first thing. These oils are converted to\nethylene and propylene which are transferred into polymers like\npolyethylene, the most common plastic. You have heard of Polythene bags\nwhich represent this form.\n\nPhthalates (prefix 'ph' is silent): Phthalates are used to make plastics\nmore flexible and found in vinyl flooring, plastic containers,\nlubricating oils, soaps and shampoos.\n\nBisphenol A or BPA: These are chemicals used to make plastic more\ntransparent and clear, like in the making of water bottles.\n\nEndocrine Functions: As part of Endocrine function, glands in our body\nrelease hormones into the bloodstream to regulate growth, metabolism and\nreproductive development. They make life happen.\n\nDo you know of the following 'Corruptions' by Plastic?\n\n-   Consumer Reports testing of many food products have for long shown\n    > evident traces of phthalates and bisphenol. Consuming packaged\n    > food products in the form of plastic packaging, cans and\n    > cardboards introduces traces of these carcinogens, cancer causing\n    > elements.\n\n-   Manufacturing of meat and processed food involves feed for animals\n    > and other elements of supply chain like packaging and movement\n    > which also increase exposure to the phthalates and bisphenol\n\n-   Traces of these carcinogens exist everywhere in the food, in the air\n    > we breath, in the water we drink, in the synthetic clothes we\n    > wear, in the phones we use, car tyres and many other unimaginable\n    > places\n\n-   Although greatly controlled and reduced in today's terms, the amount\n    > of bisphenol A (BPA) found in thermal receipts (prints of your\n    > purchases) could be very high compared to what is found in\n    > canned/packaged food\n\nConcerns have been raised about potential health effects from phthalates\nand bisphenol , particularly their ability to disrupt endocrine function\nand their possible links to health issues like asthma, reproductive\ndisorders, and developmental problems in children.\n\nSo what?\n\n-   It is estimated that we consume 500 micrograms (0.5 gram) of\n    > phthalates daily and a lot of it metabolizes through excretion\n\n-   The movement of phthalates during the metabolism impacts the\n    > endocrine system and further impacts on our reproductive system,\n    > body temperature, blood pressure and moods besides being a\n    > potential carcinogenic residue\n\n-   Accumulation of these polymers from breakage into smaller parts\n    > makes them stick in your tissue\n\n-   Plaque removed from the bloodstream of 304 patients in Italy during\n    > cardiac procedures was examined with electron microscopy.\n    > Examination revealed half the patients had 1 part of\n    > micro/nanoplastic for every 50 parts of the plaque.

Where does the world go from here?\n\nIn short, you cannot get away from this exposure to a highly corrupted\nsupply chain. You can only manage to reduce risks\n\n-   Refuse at the source, Reduce where possible and Recycle. Avoid\n    > disposable materials as much as possible\n\n-   Glass and Cans are relatively safer however the environmental burden\n    > from creating and disposing these is very high\n\n-   Be like Nikhil, bring your container where possible\n\n-   Don't be a celebrity to drink Fijian, Glacier or Recruitment Bay\n    > (for Snowflakes) bottled water as you are certainly dealing with\n    > the container based risks\n\n-   Hopefully, there will be regulations from FDA and other agencies to\n    > declare exposure to microplastics, phthalates and bisphenols as\n    > part of product labeling\n\n-   Don't buy wrapped fruit, most are already wrapped by nature in peels\n\n-   Bioplastics (created from living organisms) are the way however far\n    > away for practicality and cost efficiencies, similar to energy\n    > expectations at scale from solar, efficient batteries, green\n    > hydrogen or nuclear fission based powers\n\n-   Planet needs to cool down by 1.7 degrees within the next two\n    > decades.

They currently hold more than\n\\$182B in cash as a result.\n\nEarlier last week, at the annual shareholders day, Warren Buffett, 93,\nwho is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate\nholding company, addressed the audience for an engaging 7 hour long\ninteraction along with his team. Charlie Munger, vice chairman of the\ncompany, who passed away in November 2023, lived a fulfilling life of\nover 99 years and was remembered all the time at the meeting. Here are\nsome snippets from the shareholder's meeting, jewels of the keynote\nmessage from Mr. Buffett and a few other critical details.\n\nA single 'class A' share of Berkshire Hathaway is valued at \\$629,000 as\nI write this note. Class A shares typically offer more voting rights and\ndividends compared to Class B shares, and are often issued to founders\nand executives to maintain control over the company.\n\n-   Even after selling 115 Million shares, they will have the largest\n    > common shareholding of Apple.

How are you different? Who is your idol? What is\nyour investment strategy? Do you understand your company, country and\ncompanies that you invest in?\n\nMay 12, 2024\n\nBasics of Cellular Biology\n\nHuman body is made up of trillions of cells. Cells maintain the\norganism's health and functionality. Cells are divided into many parts\nincluding Nucleus, Mitochondria and others. Nucleus includes Chromosomes\nor (DNA) Deoxyribonucleic Acid. High School Biology stuff, pretty much.\nDNA is the hereditary material containing the instructions required for\nthe organisms to develop, survive and reproduce.\n\nHuman gut microbiome has good and bad bacteria, higher number of good\nbacteria and lower number of bad bacteria lead to a healthy gut.\nBacteria use CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic\nRepeats) for immunity against viruses. CRISPR-associated systems (CAS)\nproteins are adaptive immune systems in bacteria that protect against\nviruses.\n\nIf this was too hard to process, which it was for me, just remember that\nbacteria need healthy proteins like CAS to fight against viruses.\nNucleus of a cell contains DNA which helps us to develop, survive and\nreproduce. DNA's health determines an organism's health. Lastly, Gene is\na segment of DNA.\n\nGenes are inside the DNA and help produce the proteins. Remember, we\noften talk about genes - being good or bad or even as a personification\nof personality inheritance. So, why all this?\n\nGene Editing with Protein Language Model\n\nScientists in Harvard and Berkeley in 2010 used CAS proteins to do\ntargeted DNA/Gene editing in plant and human cells. With the ability to\nedit genes, we can kill diseases. T Cells in our bodies can attack\ncancer cells or even change the structure of plants to increase yield\nand make them disease resistant.\n\nGene editing requires constant search for CAS proteins though underway\nfor the last 10 years, it has been a slow process. Profluent, a company\nwith a tagline: 'We create bespoke proteins for breakthrough medicines',\ncreated an AI model or Protein Language Model (PML), ha ha, to create a\nnew library of CAS proteins - they took 26 Trillions of Genome data\nrepository. Through the inference of this large data set they discovered\nopenCRISPR-1 protein which is now freely available as open source for\nuse and research. open-CRISPR-1 protein is 400 mutations away from\nanything found in nature, discovered purely through inference on the\nProtein Language Model. Do you remember how one or two mutations of\nCorona virus created havoc in those days. We are looking at 400 such\nmutations with a positive connotation this time.\n\nProteins make the precise cuts in genes/DNA and AI started to predict\nwhich proteins would make a good gene editor to create dozens of gene\nediting molecules.\n\nIn short, Profluent took all of the publicly available open genome\ndatabases and created a Protein Language Model on top of this - this\ndataset can be downloaded and ingested. Profluent took 26T base pairs of\ndata to train their model; they used the model to run inference on it to\ncreate CAS systems that are far more powerful and have efficacies\ngreater than CAS proteins available in nature.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhether it is a language, images, music, videos or proteins in this\ncase, large sets of high quality domain specific data can be leveraged\nif organized correctly, with parameters labeled and trained to build\nunimaginable inferences. RLHF (Reinforced Learning with Human Feedback)\nwith robust product distribution, extraordinary experiences, AI enabled\napplications with a fundamental open source approach will rewrite the\nhistory of mankind, perhaps even rescue the planet.\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nEmulating Machine's Intelligence in Humans\n\nAI Disruptions\n\nInteracting with leaders in Bangalore, earlier last week, I started my\ntalk with these snippets and asked them to identify if there is a\nfictional representation in any one of these:\n\n-   [Klarna](https://gizmodo.com/klarna-adds-ai-photo-features-to-shopping-1850917706),\n    > a Swedish online shopping company bragged earlier in February that\n    > the company's new OpenAI-powered customer service chatbot was\n    > doing the work of 700 people---nearly two years after Klarna laid\n    > off about 700 people\n\n-   K Krithivasan, chief executive officer and managing director of Tata\n    > Consultancy Services, the country\\'s largest and globally\n    > second-largest information technology (IT) services company, said\n    > that there would be a \\'minimal\\' requirement for call centers due\n    > to the rapid adoption of AI\n\n-   Cognition, a leading tech company, has introduced Devin AI, the\n    > world's first AI software engineer.

One about AGI, to Sam's earlier definition, for it to be\nbetter than a median human being and second about being good at many\nthings and not great with things, largely speaking.\n\nEmulating Machine in Humans: Where are you going?\n\nWe as humans tend to get hyper specialized with one or two skills and\ngenerally speaking the breadth of knowledge or awareness is underrated\nin this world, Sam added at some point in his talk. Assuming AGI\n(Artificial General Intelligence) will surpass the median human's\nintelligence and given the importance of breadth in life, we need to\nbuild a stronger ability to connect with more ideas to do something\nuseful and interesting. This will keep us much higher compared to median\ncapability capture by AGI\n\n1.  LLMs for Humans: What is your Large Learning Language Model? How\n    > often do you train?

Do you?\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nAs Unsupervised ML models largely use neural networks to replicate human\nbrains in machines, above was a reversed narrative for humans to now\nemulate AI like behaviors. Hopefully, these behaviors get us in the\nhigher percentile of intellect and not become a subject of dependence on\nstate based subsidies.\n\nApril 27, 2024\n\nIn the 18 months since ChatGPT was first launched, more than a billion\npeople have accessed Large Language Models. They used them to answer\nquestions, write poetries, craft emails and as copilots. Some of them\nused them to create advanced applications on top of these models.\n\nSnowflake also announced its Arctic models that are trained\ncost-effectively, efficiently intelligent, truly open LLM and using a\nunique Dense-MoE Hybrid transformer architecture. I tried to understand\nour announcement myself and had to ask some fundamental questions. Let's\nexamine at length.\n\nWhat is a Closed Source Model? ChatGPT-4 and other versions, developed\nby OpenAI, are closed source language models. This means that their\nsource code and training data are not publicly accessible or open for\nmodification by the general public. OpenAI uses proprietary data and\ntechniques to train and improve the performance of ChatGPT models,\nkeeping these methods and the underlying code confidential.\n\nWhat is an Open Source Model? For example, Llama 3 is open source. It is\na large language model developed by Meta and is designed to be\naccessible to developers, researchers, and businesses for building,\nexperimenting, and scaling generative AI applications responsibly.\n\nWhat makes the Snowflake Arctic model Truly Open then? Snowflake is\nsharing its research insights through a comprehensive 'cookbook' that\nopens up findings. The cookbook is designed to expedite the learning\nprocess for anyone looking to build world-class MoE models. Apache 2.0\nlicense provides ungated access to weights and code. Apache 2.0 allows\nfree use, modification and distribution of Arctic even for commercial\npurposes.\n\nHow is the Snowflake Arctic Model trained effectively? Arctic was\ntrained with many-but-condensed experts with more expert choices. Arctic\nwas trained with a three-stage curriculum each with a different data\ncomposition focusing on generic skills in the first phase (1T Tokens),\nand enterprise-focused skills in the latter two phases (1.5T and 1T\ntokens). If you look at the phase 1 column below a lot of focus is\ndemonstrated on generic skills learning from the Web and more focused\napproach on code, SQL and STEM in phases 2 & 3.\n\n![](media/image16.png){width=\"5.171875546806649in\"\nheight=\"1.9560301837270342in\"}\n\nHow is the Arctic model Efficiently Intelligent? Arctic excels at\nenterprise tasks such as SQL generation, coding and instruction\nfollowing benchmarks even when compared to open source models trained\nwith significantly higher compute budgets. This will enable Snowflake\ncustomers to build applications and leverage models at a lower cost\n\nSo what the heck is the Dense MoE Hybrid Transformer Architecture?\n\nA dense transformer architecture like in Llama 2 or Llama 3 allows\nlearning from layers of information to integrate and learn from vast\namounts of data.\n\nMoE (Mixture of Experts) divides the model into many smaller specialized\nparts, each called an \"expert\". Each expert is good at handling specific\ntypes of tasks based on the question's content. Similar to different\nspecialist doctors at a hospital for a given medical issue or in the\ncase of a data platform like us whether a question pertains to SQL, Code\nor following complex instructions.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThe Arctic model provides a very high inference efficiency to allow for\npractical deployment of our models at a low cost. At large, there is a\nbig threat in open source LLMs replacing search engines.\n\nHave you played with our LLM at arctic.streamlit.app? I am still\nlearning as this unfolds. Are you? Is there anything else that can be\nlooked at?\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nHardness of Soft Skills\n\nSandeep, our PMO leader, and I were catching up earlier last week and\nthe thought came up on the importance of soft skills. needs\nimprovement - Not only are the soft skills hard to acquire, it is much\nharder to know how many of these each of us need to improve upon. I will\ndivide the write-up in parts to describe Incognizance or unawareness,\nhow to put them in practice, how they impact our lives and about the\nhurdles of putting them to practice.\n\nIncognizance\n\nA friend had once told me how in his village, of course in India, when\nthe doors opened up at the movie cinemas, people would rush to get in\nand to his surprise the rush would be to occupy the first few rows to be\nthe first ones to watch the movie. Ha ha... Let's move the same mindset\nto the corporate world.\n\nSimilarly, have you seen how at the company all hands first few rows of\nseats remain unoccupied due to the comfort found in the backbenches or\nfrom the inherent mindset to avoid facial contact. I have also seen\nsimilarly that during leadership dinners or events, very few gather the\ncourage to find a seat next to the host leader. Somehow this\nundocumented law of corporate physics states that the distance from the\nleader is proportionate to the layers in the organizational hierarchy of\nthe individual's position. Even in my staff meetings there is a usual\nbunch that finds comfort in occupying the couch seats at the back. It is\noften cited as, 'oh, this is very comfortable' and not realizing that\nthis demonstrates your innate inability to pounce on the seat at the\ntable.\n\nThis has often caused annoyance especially for the leaders that come\nfrom a different culture or geography. My personal expectation is that\nevery employed individual must quickly learn to grab that seat at the\ntable, the first key to developing strength in your soft skills.\n\nExpected respect for the elders in some cultures or the implied lessons\ntaught in traditional academic setup lead to these behaviors of not\nfinding your seat and become a roadblock for both the individual and the\norganization's growth.\n\nPutting them to Practice\n\nOnce you have your seat at the table, the first thing is to ensure you\nare willing to and open to communicating. This necessitates having a\nclear thought process, being objective and brutally honest about your\nthoughts and to be able to speak up at the right point in time. Over the\nyears, as much as I expect crispness in a message, I have built a strong\nmindset to focus on the message more than the messenger, especially if\nEnglish is not a primarily spoken language of communication for\nindividuals.\n\nSecondly, people live a lot of life around 'he said so or she said so'\nand easily deviate from the topic of purpose in the conversation or\nmeetings. Strong Emotional Intelligence in communicating with a purpose\nis far more superior than your subject matter expertise. Did the other\nperson sense respect in your tone, did you focus on the core issue and\nhave clearly defined expectations and associated outcomes when\ncommunicating?\n\nAnother key aspect is your ability to build productive workplace\nrelationships. Do you know people outside of their job designations? Do\nyou stay in the comforting company of usual suspects or build superior\nrelationships and new connections every day? Do you ensure to greet\npeople in the hallway?\n\nOn a very positive note, Mike Scarpelli, our CFO was greatly impressed\nwith the culture that we demonstrated in showing up for his all hands.\nHe witnessed an outstanding enthusiasm in the engagement and the\nconversations. The reason for this mention is to leave a question for\neach of you: Did you study about Mike and his role prior to his arrival?\nDid you contribute to the collective enthusiasm?\n\nThere are many other facets of soft skills demonstrated in workplace\netiquettes, in your grooming, in showing up on-time, in following up for\nyour tasks and even letting people know in a timely manner when the\nexpected timelines cannot be met. Others don't like surprises as much as\nour own dislike of them.\n\nImpact of Soft Skills on our lives\n\nOrganizations and people excelling in these skills create a high\nperforming culture, have flawless and common understanding of complex\ntopics/initiatives at hand, they collaborate effectively with hand-offs\nand provide great support to each other. Our collective problem solving\ncapacity increases tremendously and no goal remains unachievable.\n\nHurdles\n\nThe biggest hurdle in this can only be 'me'. Positivity rubs on easily.\nYour being really good in these skills will bring reciprocation from all\nothers with much ease.\n\nWhat is your assessment? Do you know your blind spots? Do you/we excel\nwith these? Do you ever judge others or just focus on playing your part?\nDid I miss a skill that could be mentioned here or in another writeup?\n\nApril 13, 2024\n\nWe don't need no education...\n\nAbout a decade ago a young man, my colleague's son, came to me for\nacademic guidance to pick a stream of education in engineering. I\nsuggested to him a simple exercise since he came in with a clean slate:\nmake a list of engineering streams and evaluate each of the streams with\nwhat the future holds for them with growth, transformation and\nemployment in perspective. Evaluate for another factor to tie the stream\nwith your passion and natural inclination for study. I gave him some\npointers for the first part.\n\nHe chose to study chemical engineering and finished his postgraduate in\nindustrial engineering to start his career as a software engineer.\nImagine how much of a jump start was missed.\n\nAnother situation, I am interviewing someone with 15+ years of work\nexperience and this individual worked for her current employer for over\na dozen years. To my question of how do you build skills for the future,\nthe response was 'I listen to podcasts of my leaders during my drive\ntime'. I asked her to name a topic or quote an example, nothing specific\nshe could respond with.\n\nWhen I interview, I often ask about a candidate's learning ability and\nintellectual investment, specifically to understand their knowledge\nmedia and areas of interest.\n\nSo why this preface... ? Let's unfold.\n\nCost of Education\n\nAs depicted in the image, technology costs have continuously decreased\nover the 20 years in the bottom set while the cost of education has\ngrown exponentially, only to be second to healthcare costs. Even though\nthis represents only the US, other geographies experience similar\ntrends.\n\nIf we look at the options available on e-learning platforms, the\nadjacent and specialized training curricula is available much easily and\nat a very affordable price point. This is a very logical economically\nattractive middle ground where informal academia leverages technology.\n\n![](media/image12.png){width=\"3.75in\" height=\"3.5in\"}\n\nExaggeration from Academia\n\nLatest reported numbers from Hindustan Times\\* indicate that 36% of 2024\nIIT Mumbai graduates are yet to receive a job placement. It is hard to\nascertain at this point if this is a one time representation or a trend\nrepresenting a mismatch between academia and the changing needs of\nprofessional organizations, or even the sheer number of jobs out there.\nI have already seen many graduates from non-prime/non-IIT institutes\nthat are either unemployed or that they move into significantly\nunderpaying/underskilled job opportunities.\n\nMany times we get attracted to a formal MBA like program. Incremental\ninvestment in a formal master's degree can lead to a one time big ticket\nprice or a long term debt that you will repay through loan payments.\nWhereas, focused learning programs like becoming a flight attendant or\nnurse offer a very relevant work opportunity with a much quicker/better\nreturn on academic investment.\n\nWhile not discounting the value of education, it is really important to\nappreciate the skill gained compared to the demands across industries.\nIn some cases, it is also okay to stick to your initial career choice in\nalignment with your academic qualification. This needs both patience and\nperseverance.\n\nWhat holds true\n\nHere are some guardrails to employ:\n\n-   If you want to pursue higher education, especially if it involves a\n    > big financial commitment and/or a new stream, ensure you have\n    > validated with all possible resources.

What experiences do you have\nto share? What can your leader/organization do to better them?\n\n\\*https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/36-iit-b-students-fail-to-get-jobs-in-24-101712084983374.html\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\nLast week, I wrote about the X-Factors required as major ingredients in\nour personal growth. A few more thoughts on how to make X-Factors\nrelevant in the age of AI/LLMs.\n\nGrowth from Eras of Industrial Revolution and '.com' Boom\n\nIn the Industrial Revolution and the '.com' Revolution, machines and\ncomputers significantly improvised traditional businesses. Introduction\nof tractors led to productivity on the farms, reduced costs and\nincreased volumes of high quality agricultural yields. Introduction of\nComputers, which were assumed to displace jobs as represented by the\nmedia publications in the 80s (remember, there was no social media\nthen), actually led to enhanced jobs, increased productivity and\nidentification of sub-industries through Desktop Publications, Computer\nAided Design and many more avenues.\n\nHere is a sneak peek into the distribution of GDP (Gross Domestic\nProducts) over the years and by components. Distribution of GDP for the\nUS as a % of Consumer/Personal consumption (50-60%), Government\nSpending/Investments (20%), Private Investments (20%) and net of Import\nand Export (10%) has largely remained the same. Growing and Stable\neconomies will show similar consistency in distribution and the overall\nGDP grew year-over-year. This will be true for most of the large and\nstable economies.\n\nPerceived Impact of LLMs on Growth\n\nAge of AI/LLMs will make these trends look a bit different. Here is how:\n\n> 1\\. Technology workers will have to live through this shift making it\n> personal\n>\n> 2\\. We have already seen reduction of workforces in recent years and\n> unlike the farmers and manual laborers in the industrial revolution,\n> this phase impacts white-collared workers as well\n>\n> 3\\. Social Media has already begun scaring us all with the widespread\n> narratives of AI/LLMs taking away jobs\n>\n> 4\\.

Manual labor was replaced by machines in the Industrial Revolution\n> and white-collar labor will be replaced/augmented by AI/LLMs in this\n> time and age\n\nWhat it should/will look like?\n\nThere is a big HOWEVER to all this. So how will it be different:\n\n> 1\\. Firstly, the productivity gain will be 10x to 100x from the AI\n> advent. In the short term productivity gains will be huge, in the\n> mid-term some jobs will be eliminated/changed and in the long range\n> many more jobs will be created\n>\n> 2\\. If you are an architect you will be able to create a design in\n> 10th of the time, media houses will be able to significantly increase\n> movie productions, healthcare companies will be able to diagnose\n> problems much quicker and many more benefits like these will be\n> evident\n>\n> 3\\. As such, more work will be done in volumes, with higher\n> productivity, reducing costs and ballooning the economies\n>\n> 4\\. You will see a definite convergence of Software and Services\n> (Legal, Healthcare, Financial... you name it) with AI/LLMs. More\n> industries will be created similar to the Industrial Revolution and\n> the '.com' Revolution\n>\n> 5\\.

Are you participating? If not, do you know\nwhat it takes?\n\nMarch 31 2024\n\nGrowth of Nations & People\n\nIndia is predicted to be the 3rd largest nation in the race of Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP) growth and its GDP is currently projected to\nsurpass \\$4T for the year 2024. The United States, China, Germany and\nJapan are ahead of India in this measure.\n\nThere are other measures in addition to the GDP of 'GDP per capita' (GDP\ndivided by the population), GVA (Gross Value Adds) and PPP (Purchasing\nPrice Parity). While the GDP per capita may be a lower number based on\nthe number of citizens in a country, there is also a factor of\nPurchasing Price Parity which you can imagine from the ability to\ndetermine what a rupee can purchase for you in India compared to a\ndollar in the United States. A simple example can be in the form of\nhaircut cost in India which can range from 100 rupees to north of 500+\nrupees at a fancy salon. Haircut costs in the United States can vary\nfrom \\$10 (830 rupees) to \\$40 (4100+ rupees), or even more.\n\nHow is the GDP calculated?\n\nAs calculated with an expenditure based approach GDP of a country is\ncalculated as\n\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M) where\n\n-   C =\\> Consumption by all the households\n\n-   I =\\> Investments made within the country\n\n-   G =\\> Government Spending\n\n-   X =\\> Exports (Like Agricultural products or Technology Services )\n\n-   M =\\> Imports (Like Oil or Defense Spend)\n\nWhile the numbers and measures will always have subjectivity, how much\nbetter you are today compared to your yesterday matters the most,\nwhether you are an individual, a company or a country. Let's use this\nanalogy keeping people or let's say specifically each of us in mind.\n\nNetwork Growth: An Individual's View\n\nI got a call from a past colleague as she was seeking some advice for a\nsituation. She expressed her inability to deal with a work situation and\nexpressed her vulnerability. We spent quite some time discussing the\nmatter and I provided some guidance to navigate certain situations. She\nwas thankful for me spending precious time out of my busy schedule. So,\nwhat?\n\nWell, as a starter, this person does not work in my current\norganization, reached out to me to say hello and to discuss her\nopportunity areas along with some vulnerabilities. Essentially, she\nnetworked with me. Keep this interaction in mind as we build a logic\naround Personal Network Growth as a formula.\n\nNetworking to me is 'Net' of your 'Work' with a strong focus on\nhuman-to-human orchestration. Let's define a measure as 'Network\nDevelopment Plan (NDP)' with a myopic focus on people and relationships.\n\nNDP = C + R + I + (X - A) where\n\n-   NDP =\\> Network Development Plan\n\n-   C =\\> Content\n\n-   R =\\> Relationships\n\n-   I =\\> Investments\n\n-   X =\\> X Factor\n\n-   A =\\> Abscondment\n\nC (Content) refers to your core competence, the work done, and the sole\npurpose that you are attached to both your position and your\norganization. You spend years in a job and how you do your job will grow\nyour personal brand. In the last few years, I have hired more than 15%\nof my team from past references and work relationships. I would not have\nhired these people and many more that I can still hire unless they built\na very strong brand from competence, high degree of commitment and\nassociated accomplishments.\n\nR (Relationships) refers to people we have met in the past associations,\npeople in the current organization and the people that you meet outside\nof your work. When you see my reference to people here, it does not\nnecessarily only mean people that can influence your career but also\nincludes the ones who you can help and support. You never know who can\nbe of assistance when a need arises. When you initiate a new\nprofessional relationship always have a context to build engagement, a\nwell defined broad purpose and and not just an intent that leads to\nimmediate gains.\n\nI (Investments): I get many invites on my professional media accounts\nand sometimes after you accept the invite within an hour you get a\nrequest for a job application or evaluation of a product that they want\nto sell. Sure, I was sitting here with all the free time, waiting for\nsomeone to call me, write to me and for me to hire them or to evaluate\ntheir product. You get the point. You don't build relationships without\ninvestments. Now go back to the colleague who reached out for a\ndiscussion on a topic related to vulnerability that she wished to\ndiscuss. Seeking help is the best way to connect with people and as much\nas you think that the other person will be busy, it most always is your\nimagination. You will miss every shot that you don't take.\n\nX Factor: I asked Abhishek Mishra, our data leader, to come up with a\nplan that encompasses a framework for both our Snow@Snow initiatives and\nour go-to-market framework. Details of this point of view demonstrates\nhis X-Factor and the X-Factor that you can create. This is what the\nframework comprises of:\n\n-   A section that tracks our customer use-cases demonstrating best in\n    > class Data Cloud practices along with usage of the New Product\n    > Introductions (NPIs) and features\n\n-   A section that lists all of the specific customer engagements to\n    > showcase these use cases and capabilities to our global customers\n    > as a reference library\n\n-   List of all the recently completed and planned webinars, whitepapers\n    > and blogs\n\n-   Our involvement in engaging with how we can support the Snowflake's\n    > Academia Program in the region. There are many who are\n    > contributing to this already as their own X-Factor\n\n-   On a side note, we also have our 'AI for Everyone' initiative that\n    > Rahul Jain, another data leader, is running for our teams. This is\n    > Rahul and a few others who are contributing effectively to this as\n    > their X-Factor\n\nThe beauty and the beast-y sense of the X-Factors is, most always, you\nwork on them without expecting an immediate tangible return or a reward.\nYou will need to look around within your organization and you will find\nmany opportunities that eventually will drive your NDP (Network\nDevelopment Plan) score, although this is not going to be a direct\nfinancial measure.\n\nA (Abscondment) can also be treated as avoidance. This can be a function\nof not having prioritized this investment, taking the time out of your\npersonal space for personal development, discomfort in reaching out, and\nsometimes lack in sight of opportunities that need driving the\nextra-mile. \"Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed\nin overalls and looks like work.\", said somebody.\n\nIf your NDP (Network Development Plan) is measured as the first degree\nof your super trusted relationships, what is the current measure of your\nNet's Worth and what has the growth rate looked like in the last few\nyears? What does the future hold? Always, looking for feedback to see\nhow many of you want to Network on this note. 😉\n\nMarch 24 2024\n\nI got to see Jeff Bezos' leadership video again this weekend. It\nreminded me of the best practices then and I looked at these best\npractices to introspect and reflect on some of them.\n\nPassion Chooses You:\n\nJeff reminds us that we don't choose our passion and our passion chooses\nus. Some of us are talented with a skill that comes to us in the form of\na gift. For example, some of us are naturally gifted with skills to\nunderstand numbers or that we may have great grasping and/or analytical\nabilities to decipher a complex situation.\n\nTalent not Practiced is only good on piece of a paper\n\nThe idea is to not just be proud of these gifts but to know how we have\nused these gifts or skills. Did you practice them for good usage and\nwhen you look back at life do you feel proud of efforts that led to\ngreatly utilizing these skills? Do you measure tangible returns from\nyour effort investments?\n\nFlexible Mindset\n\nAlso he mentions that good leaders are 'right a lot'. What does this\neven mean? Well, essentially good leaders listen, they change their mind\na lot and disconfirm their most profound convictions. It is very easy to\nreconfirm our beliefs with situations and it is really hard to\ndisconfirm a certain preconceived notion.\n\nWhen you have gathered more data or with experiences, you can change\nyour mind. Politicians largely are not allowed to change their mind as\nit can greatly impact their posture in the world of politics. Corporates\nneed to work without political manifestations and if we do not build the\nability to change our minds then we are dramatically underestimating the\ncomplexity of our worlds. For example, we may have an opinion of an\nindividual based on a notion and as you experience events with this\nindividual, you will learn certain aspects of her skills or intent and\nreally what you preconceived needs to change. I have seen that many\ntimes in my personal assessment of people.\n\nVision and Execution\n\nHave a clear vision that is largely fixated however when you execute you\nwill need flexibility with details. Be relentless on the vision and when\nyou execute to try and implement the vision, you will make wrong\ndecisions and you will need to course correct.\n\nFailure and Innovation are inseparable twins. You cannot invent without\nfailures and we need to grow the size of failures as we grow the\norganizations. As a child, we were always taught of trial and error\nmode, the grown up world does not need to behave differently.\n\nTwo Pizza Teams\n\nAny team that needs more than two pizzas for lunch on an assignment are\ntoo big and will complicate matters. Ideally, keeping in mind the sizes\nof pizzas in the US, two pizzas feed 10-12 people, so you get the point.\n\nMemos vs. Slides\n\nThis is slightly contentious in a way. Amazon practices 6 page written\nmemos in preparation for meetings. Everyone takes the time before the\nmeeting or at the start of the meeting to go through the memos. No power\npoints here. Memos have verbs, grammar and sentences.\n\nSome Questions here to Introspect:\n\nI have personally preferred slides as a good slide/picture can\ndemonstrate 1000 words and we all know that. Also, should I not feed the\nmemos to an LLM to make succinct highlights out of it as opposed to\nreading the memo or both, read and identify LLM based insights?\n\nHave you as an individual or a leader acknowledged a time when you\nchanged your mind or your opinion about something/someone?\n\nHave you encountered failures during your invention cycles and learnt\nfrom them? Have you given opportunities for your people to fail or for\nyourself to fail?\n\nAs part of executing your strategies, have you encountered chaos from\nteething issues?\n\nMarch 17 2024\n\nRewards, Results and Returns\n\nRemember, when you were a kid there was a task and a reward. You clean\nyour room and get screen time. Schools similarly worked on the premise\nof studying well and getting good results. Fixed Deposits work similarly\nand where you get your returns on your investment on a predetermined\nbasis.\n\nAlthough nothing will happen without perseverance, professional journeys\nwill never be as linearly deterministic. We often fall in the trap of\nlinear expectations of compensation and promotions, many times leading\nto disappointment. As an employee a lot of factors, controllable and\nuncontrollable, play a big role:\n\n-   First and foremost, since companies are designed with growth,\n    > performance and profit perspectives, your growth will always be in\n    > reflection of the need. Need for a position at the next level will\n    > determine a significant career change. Your potential to perform\n    > at the next level and your exemplary performance in the current\n    > position are expected irrespectively\n\n-   Sometimes there is a change in leadership and organization structure\n    > that can also reset both the understanding of your personal\n    > narrative and of the leader's expectation\n\n-   Unlike a classroom where your study groups are filled with\n    > comparable individuals, organization is a very comprehensive mix\n    > of experience levels and the roles that people perform. Job\n    > expectations and criticality of many positions may not be obvious\n    > to us, leading to preconceived biases\n\nGrowth Orientation\n\nIf you work for an organization that is built on strong values and\nbeliefs then expect that the right results will yield, sometimes needing\npatience. This necessitates\n\n-   Seeking big challenges, asking for autonomy to perform tasks and\n    > focusing on results\n\n-   Focus on a strong connection of your objectives and outcomes\n    > directly relating to transformation, innovation, and growth\n    > (product, customers and revenue)\n\n-   Something else I learnt in Jansen Huang's keynote with Stanford\n    > students. Accomplished students have high expectations as they\n    > have already worked hard in academia. High expectations make you\n    > less resilient so it is best to then have super realistic and low\n    > expectations, which will make you resilient. Resilience gives you\n    > power to quickly stand back on your feet each time you fall down\n\n-   Seeking feedback and leveraging on your support network is also\n    > critically important\n\n-   Grit necessitates working relentlessly on tasks, knowing the meaning\n    > and purpose of work at hand and staying strongly connected with\n    > it. The day you feel that you are in a dreadful situation,\n    > magically a ray of success will appear\n\nImagine that you are running your own business for a second.\nEntrepreneurship needs a lot more patience and relentlessness -\nguarantees are even further reduced due to factors totally out of your\ncontrol.\n\nIn a nutshell continuous learning, long term career transforming goals\nslated for next 3-5 years, having a low expectation and highly resilient\nmindset will take you a long way.\n\nMarch 10 2024\n\nThis write-up is a tribute to the 'Amp' that Frank (Slootman) initiated\npersonally for me and for many individuals around the world.\n\nIn the month of February, 2010, I joined MSC Software to build its\n'India Entity' similar to starting Snowflake 10 years later. My first\nday was at our office in Southern California and it coincided with Bob\nHarder's 40th work anniversary in the company. Yes, you read it right -\n40th. Median age of this reader group is far lower than 40. Bob worked\nfor MSC software for all his professional life and continued until 2\nweeks before passing away in his 80s. Similarly, I know of another\ncolleague who worked at IBM for 25+ years, in this case working for the\nsame reporting manager for 25 years. Let's look at different points of\nview for what your professional life should drive for and how/when a\ncareer shift is initiated.\n\nAmped Up Life:\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge and thank Frank for his leadership and for\nhaving 'Amped Us Up'. A lot of us were shocked and thought, 'Frank, a\nfew more years. Please stay back.' Very rarely in your lifespan you will\ncome across someone who is so accomplished and inspirational and there\nare many takeaways. Here are some jewels from his second book, 'Amp it\nup': I had an amazing opportunity to go back to my notes\n\nFor Me:\n\n-   Raise your standards\n\n-   Focus: Mile wide and inch deep does not work. Work on a few\n    > Prioritized Goals\n\n-   Type Faster: Sense of Urgency, Compress Cycles, Apply Pressure, & be\n    > Impatient\n\n-   Get Uncomfortable as our roles will not remain the same\n\n-   Avoid Mediocrity and avoid Attaching to the Past\n\n-   Grow Fast or Die Slowly\n\n-   You are a Product: Be Purposeful - Meaningful Experience matters\n    > more than an MBA\n\n-   Avoid having Short Tenured Jobs. Stick around long enough to be\n    > Somebody\n\n-   Don't spend more time on Solutions. Diagnose Problems\n\nAs a Leader:\n\n-   Communicate: As leader, Over-communicate and be the Chief Reminding\n    > Officer\n\n-   Ownership: Your team has to feel like owners\n\n-   Declare a war against competition and incrementalism:\n\n    -   Hospitality Companies did not become AirBnB\n\n    -   Taxi Companies did not become Uber\n\n    -   Automobile Companies did not become Tesla\n\n-   Think about where you want to be in the future and work backwards\n\n-   Intellectual Honesty: Recognize Dangers from Groupthink and\n    > Confirmation Bias\n\n-   Consultants: They will borrow your watch, tell you the time & then\n    > keep the watch\n\n-   Hire Drivers not Passengers. Get Passengers off the Bus\n\n-   Deep Reluctance to Fire People is very common\n\n-   Find the Right Talent and Do not rush to Hire\n\n-   Maintain an active Recruiting Posture: Hire before the Needs\n    > (Critical Positions)\n\n-   People Learn from Consequences not Posters\n\n-   Appreciate the Variance between the Stated/Desired Culture and the\n    > Reality\n\n-   Go Direct and Build Mutual Trust. Don't Play Defense\n\n-   Reminder of 5 Dysfunctions of a Team (Patrick Leoncini):\n\n    -   Inattention to Results\n\n    -   Avoidance of Accountability\n\n    -   Lack of Commitment\n\n    -   Fear of Conflict\n\n    -   Absence of Trust\n\n-   Build Right Products and Repeatable Sales Processes\n\n-   Don't Outsource Recruitment\n\nWhen you look at the leader list above, review with a lens for the\nleader you will become, the leader you are and the help that you can\nprovide to your leader with these backdrops.\n\n(Un)Attaching to People/Work\n\nFrank's departure fits somewhere in Expecting the Unexpected Outcomes in\nmy book of experiences. There is so much that our new leader Sridhar\nbrings in the world of AI/LLM so more about that at a later point.\n\nWhat is a good time to Move on:\n\nLife Events: Most always, unless there is a compelling life event, you\nneed not look outside for a new opportunity. If you work for a great\ncompany and a great culture then you will find something to do even when\nthere are life events unless you are going back to school.\n\n-   There is no substitute for continuous learning. Formal academia\n    > though helps give both structure and attention, is not the only\n    > source of learning. Remember, meaningful experiences are far more\n    > powerful than an MBA degree\n\n-   With life events, good companies enable change in job profile,\n    > geography or also create part-time opportunities. You need to be a\n    > role model employee as well for this to happen\n\n-   Your career rotation opportunities will be best presented within an\n    > organization, most always\n\nWhen do we actually do it and Why?\n\nMost always, 'actual' decisions are not 'factual', but rather emotional.\nWe tend to find an escape route with discomfort arising from:\n\n-   I cannot work for this person. We have heard many times that people\n    > don't leave jobs, they leave a manager. While this might be\n    > possible, you have a role to play here to address challenges\n    > arising from such situations\n\n-   A past colleague or an ex-manager is calling you\n\n-   Better pay, different job, better work environment and promotions,\n    > which may have their own perceptions\n\nMy point is to not discourage anyone to look for career growth; however\nthey cannot be an outcome of having a poor self-assessment or detaching\nfrom your responsibilities to yourself and the greater organization.\n\nWhat should we actually do?\n\n-   Firstly, being honest to self and being self-critical is where\n    > everyone must start\n\n-   Engage with your manager(s)/management and have candid conversations\n\n-   Be strongly aware of your own gaps with skills and expectations\n\n-   Ask for help and support\n\n-   Aim for superlative performance and a very strong personal brand\n    > narrative\n\n-   Understand the point of view of what your career will transform into\n    > in 3 years, not a raise or promotion that you expect today\n\n-   Eliminate distractions about monetary expectations.

Do you have a personal favorite POV? A story to\nshare? Looking forward to it.\n\nMarch 3 2024\n\nHere is part II of the AI/LLM write-up with addition of a few more\nsurprises and updates from this week.\n\nAI is unfolding competition and platform challenges similar to what had\ntranspired in the search and the browser era. However, the impact on our\nlives is much greater from these changes at least from what I infer.\n\nGoogle Gemini: 'Role Model' Challenges in the Model Behaviors\n\nGoogle rechristened it's AI platform from Bard to Duet AI to Gemini now.\nEarlier last week, Google suspended its image generation capability\nafter it generated embarrassing and offensive results. They had to\npublicly apologize for missing the mark as it tried to overcompensate\nfor diversity in the responses generated by the models, with the\nunderlying role model behaviors.\n\nWhen we search for something with traditional search modalities, we are\noffered an array of options usually, including some of the promotional\nreferences. AI, on the contrary, has to give only one answer. Given\nthat, Gemini has come on the defensive mode and is asking users to use\nGoogle search when responding to sensitive (even the ones perceived to\nbe sensitive) questions.\n\nThis might necessitate the reinforcement in the input interactions with\nthe models by providing a lot more contextual prompting, context setting\nand reflection based response improvement. Models unlike humans will not\nhave delete capabilities, so you keep reiterating by asking the model to\nimprove its responses from reflections. Usually, 3 reflections lead to\nimprovements of a model's generation (example ChatGPT 3.5 to ChatGPT\n4.0) however this also introduces a delay. In this instance, you are\nusing the reinforcement through an individual's feedback as compared to\ngeneral improvements that the LLMs make through Reinforced Learning from\nHuman Feedback, more as a collective representation from many humans.\n\nIn the email to his employees that publicly appeared on quite a few\nsocial media, Sundar Pichai has vowed to make structural changes in the\ncompany to address these challenges. This is an early phase of the LLM\nlife so certainly we will see a lot of learning and corrections in the\nprocess.\n\nOn a separate note, Elon Musk is suing OpenAI and Sam Altman for\nviolating the principles and premise for its not for profit foundation.\n\nData: Growth, Relevance and Cost of Data Acquisition\n\nIt is predicted that the data grows at 2.5 Quintillion bytes on a daily\nbasis. 1,024 Terabytes make a Petabyte. 1,024 Petabytes make an Exabyte,\nalso referred to as a Quintillion byte.\n\nAbout 10% of this can be estimated to be available on the internet,\nwhich itself will be a large set to absorb and process for learning.\nAlso, more than half the data generated is not of much relevance to the\ngreater world. A lot of the data also sits behind platforms or media.\n\nGoogle (Gemini) has contracts with Reddit (\\$60M a year) and Stack\nOverflow to consume data for its learning and use. OpenAI, post the New\nYork Times lawsuit controversy, is similarly making an agreement with\ndozens of publishers to license content for training.\n\nMany questions will come over time to know how these purchases will lead\nto monopolies like Google search or not? Will investments in humans get\nrestructured to invest in contents? If the models are not deterministic\nby definition how can one determine the value of the content purchased\nthrough the LLM's Matrixed Black Box? Can/Will the content access be\nexplicit to some providers?\n\nFullstacks from Silicon Manufacturers vs. Silicon Manufacturing by\nHyperscalers\n\nAMD GPUs offer competitive pricing and excellent performance for gaming\nand general tasks. NVIDIA, however, leads in ray tracing technology and\nAI-driven applications. The best choice to make will vary based on\nprice, performance needs, and software ecosystem preferences, making the\ncomparison not straightforward but rather contextual. NVIDIA has nailed\nthe game for the immediate future for sure as it offers a holistic full\nstack platform that is beyond the chipsets for excelling in the LLM\nspace.\n\nAt the same time, following the lead of TPU/LPU conversation from last\nweek, imagine that AWS, Google, Meta and many more are aiming to build\nand release their own inference silicon. They already have the power of\ntheir full stack platforms. Of course, building a chipset is a very big\nundertaking.\n\nThere is also a risk with NVIDIA GPU demand that if you used a platform\nfrom another supplier your GPU orders may get deprioritized.\n\nMy Take on the Future: It is only bright\n\nAs we play at the intersection of Data, AI and Applications, I can only\nsay that the future is bright. This necessitates all of us to embrace\nand know AI else you will be threatened from not being in the game.\n\n-   NVIDIA sold \\$22B worth of hardware, largely the GPUs in Q4. \\$13B\n    > in profits. Now this is huge, just in a quarter\n\n-   This game is expanding. Even with other players/manufacturers of\n    > LPUs or otherwise the game is getting bigger in terms of\n    > investments in infrastructure\n\n-   To implement and make the best use of \\$22B worth of hardware will\n    > need another 3x investment in resources.

You cannot\n    > expect your customers to interconnect your disparate capabilities\n    > from inorganic/acquisitive growth\n\nI want to end this note here with two key takeaways: Stay Invested and\nInterested in the Modern AI/Data Stack and Platforms. You will be the\ncreators of the future.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading all the way through and will look\nforward to your responses. Perhaps time to shift gears with an outlook\non economies/economics next week. Have a great week.\n\nFebruary 25 2024\n\nI decided to catch up on my AI notes this week so this one will be\nslightly geeky and macroeconomy based write-up. A lot of details so\nensure you are dedicating some time right now to be able to absorb what\nis going on.\n\nOne thing to understand as a keynote of this message is that all LLM\nmodels and many of the AI models are represented in the form of a\nmatrix. Capabilities of AI infrastructure are a measure of speed and\nsize of the matrices that are multiplied. This understanding will help\nyou appreciate the LLMs and AI Infrastructure for a very long time to\ncome.\n\nNVIDIA and the Soar of Sora\n\nWith the skyrocketed revenues and growth, NVIDIA is now the 4th largest\nin value behind Microsoft, Apple and Saudi Aramco. They reported\noutstanding revenue growth demonstrating the high potential of the AI\nworld.\n\nOpenAI announced the release of Sora, a prompt based video generation\ncapability. OpenAI's Platform now has the ability to generate up to 60\nseconds long videos based on your imaginative narration.\n\nUnreal vs. Artificial\n\n'Unreal Engine 5', a product of Epic Games, which has existed much\nlonger than the realm of LLMs, creates real-time 3D photoreal visuals\nand immersive experiences. Unreal Engine employs photogrammetry,\ncapturing multiple photographs of a real-world object or scene and\ncreates 3d models, capturing with it textures, colors, lights and other\nattributes of the physical world.\n\nSora, as a natural extension of the Large Language model, creates videos\nfrom prompts through training the model with a lot of real world\nexamples. It will be interesting to find out how the Sora models were\ntrained. They possibly were built from tagging and labeling the outputs\ngenerated from Unreal Engine 5 mentioned above, and perhaps a few more\nproducts similar to Unreal Engine 5.\n\nHave you tried using 'Dall.E' or Midjourney to create images? Assuming\nthat the experience of using Sora will be very similar, each time you\nask to improvise an image or a video, the generated results through\nimprovisation are significantly different. For example if you ask Dall.E\nor Midjourney to create an image and if you provide a prompt to\nimprovise the image for image or the text change in the image, the\nentire image gets recreated in many ways. Each instance creates a\nsignificantly different representation for improvisation. This is\nbecause the rendering in AI tools unlike in photoshop, Unreal Engine or\nAutocad, is based on Matrices. Traditional CAD and Image Management\ntools are based on layers which are more controllable in nature.\n\nEventually, this will necessitate marriage of compute/layer trained\nmodels like in Photoshop, Unreal Engine or Autocad with AI trained\nmodels like Sora and Gemini. The objects rendered by AI/LLM models can\npotentially become input to the traditional tools so that the black\nboxes from LLMs can get a more flavors. Other way around is also a\npossibility.\n\nWe have come so far so nothing looks impossible. With that, as promised\nfor a bit longer write-up this time, let's shift focus on the AI compute\nnarrative.\n\nFuture of AI compute\n\nLet's go back to basics as we build this up.\n\nCPUs and GPUs: CPUs (Central Processing Units) are used for general\npurpose sequential computing. GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)\nspecialize in parallel processing with thousands of cores that help with\ngraphics rendering and machine learning. An example of NVIDIA GPU is\nH100 which is designed for accelerating AI, High Performance Computing\n(HPC) and Graphics.\n\nTPUs (Tensor Processing Unit): TPU is a specialized hardware accelerator\ndesigned by Google for deep learning tasks and is optimized for speed\nand scale, outperforming CPUs and some GPUs in terms of throughput. TPUs\nwere designed in 2016 to accelerate speech recognition and search\nalgorithms. An important data point to introduce here is 100 ms of\nimprovement in response performance, improves traffic by 8% of a given\ninteraction medium.\n\nIntroducing Groq and the LPU (Language Processing Unit)\n\nJonathan Ross, who was one of the founding members of the TensorFlow and\nthe Tensor Processing Unit (TPUs) at Google is the founder of Groq.\n\nWhat are the unique characteristics of Groq LPU (Language Processing\nUnit)?\n\n-   Groq is built on the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) concept\n    > used in the build out of TPUs. As implied in the name, Gates\n    > (engineers - remember the days of circuit design and gates - this\n    > is not a reference to Bill) are built to be Programmable\n    > dynamically after manufacturing of the silicon.\n\n-   For most of the AI and for all LLMs, matrix multiplication is the\n    > biggest problem for improving the speed of execution\n\n-   LPUs are built to perform inference at a very high speed\n\n-   Understand that the models are already built, both in the open and\n    > closed source format and the quality of performance is already\n    > addressed. What remains is the speed of execution in using these\n    > models\n\n-   In the definition of CPUs and GPUs, we discussed parallel\n    > processing. However for Generative AI speed requirements far\n    > exceed the parallelization expectations. This is because to\n    > predict 100th token of the response, it can only be done after the\n    > 99th token is predicted\n\n-   Each token prediction in Generative AI usually will have the\n    > requirement to pick one from 32,000 available tokens. Imagine\n    > response speed required to pick one token after the other from an\n    > array of 32000 distinct tokens for each token pick\n\n-   GPUs use external memory and LPUs use internal memories so they are\n    > actually very fast andare speed intensive, especially to make them\n    > helpful for Generative AI\n\n-   Modern GPUs are built at 3 to 4 Nanometer scale and are incredibly\n    > expensive, both to build and to buy. Groq LPU is built at about 14\n    > Nanometer size. Understand that smaller the size greater the\n    > complexity\n\n-   GPUs generate about 120 tokens every second. LPUs generate about 240\n    > tokens a second and the test version already is generating 330\n    > tokens a second. This number will only improvise\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nGiven this transformation, the LPU platform will possibly be acquired or\nbuilt by the mainstream chip companies. They may be able to compete\nindependently as well.\n\nNVIDIA probably has little threat from the mainstream competitive chip\nmanufacturers however these alternative technology platforms will pose a\nthreat for sure.\n\nI have more thoughts to actually create a part II of this write up for\nnext week.\n\nSo, what do you think will happen next? Let me know if this narrative\nmade sense after a long break that I had on my AI/LLM updates and if you\nare excited to hear part II. I am super excited to write my next set of\nobservations and some predictions.\n\n**February 18 2024**\n\n**Tale of Two Social Media**\n\nMeta (known as Facebook then) and Snap both outperformed as a social\nmedia enterprise in the Covid and ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy)\ntimes.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nMeta increased its R&D focus to invest in headsets and Metaverse over\nthe last few years. Meta realized the untimeliness and/or the relevance\nof their innovation strategy and made some changes. Let's look at what\ntranspired.\n\n**The Response**\n\n-   Meta's superlative R&D spends were not making sense\n\n-   Meta reduced its headcount by 22% from 82,000+ to \\~67,0"

Does this really happen? How do\nyou see the mirror to know when you don't get it right with others? It\ndemands authenticity and a natural self.\n\nWhen you are artificially nice to people in socially awkward moments,\nyou may not know but under your hidden discomfort all of a sudden your\nheart pounds and occasionally raises your blood pressure.\n\nSo, why this mention and where are the awkward moments?\n\nYou may find this situation in new relationships, in unchartered\nterritories with people and most usually when giving or receiving\nfeedback, especially speaking in the corporate context with your manager\nor with your team member, at both ends of the equation.\n\nFirstly, unknowingly, 'sugar' plays a key role in these. We most always\nfind comfort in being nice, in compliments and patronizing in\nconversations with unnecessary positivity.\n\nSecondly, most usually as a recipient, we start fidgeting, avoiding eye\ncontact with the presenter, we cross our arms, we may have an awkward\neye movement, we occasionally pull the chair around and palms possibly\nget sweaty as the sucralose rubs on as a sweetener.\n\nWith these under the skin responses and when you are artificially nice\nor someone else is artificially nice to you, you get awkward moments.\nMost importantly, we experience cardiovascular stress, unknown to our\nown physiology.\n\nSo, How should we actually deal when giving or receiving feedback?\n\n-   Firstly, DO NOT patronize with unnecessarily nice feedback as you\n    > are somewhere ruining your reputation\n\n-   Ensure that you always have data and specificity to back your\n    > qualifying statements\n\n-   If I suggest that you do not use sweeteners, it also means that you\n    > need not be rude in your interactions\n\n-   When providing feedback to others start with small specific\n    > constructive data points in a couple of dimensions\n\n-   Stop giving generic feedback like you need to improve your\n    > communications or you need to be more visible.

Salary raise, recognition, peer comparison, new house, new car or\nnew assets are all implied elements of material progress and absence of\nthese events is perceived as lack of progress, which make us unhappy.\n\nInflation: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices\nfor goods and services rises, reducing purchasing power.\n\nAnnual Inflation: 2% annual inflation growth target was first adopted by\nNew Zealand in 1990, as proposed by Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash.\nThis has become relatively a global baseline in the last 40 years which\nneeds revisiting as inflation largely has surpassed this assumption in\nthe recent past.\n\nInterest rates established by Federal Reserve Bank in the United States\nusually tend to be higher than inflation rate. As a result, the interest\nrates have been higher post the covid era following the inflationary\neconomy.\n\nLiquidity of Capital: In order for businesses to prosper, liquidity of\nmoney, which relates to access to capital, must be high. This largely\nrelates to the growth orientation of the companies.\n\nSo, Why all this?\n\nLow inflation leads to lowe interest rates. Low interests will lead to\neasier access to capital and better opportuntiies for busiensses and\neconomies to prosper. This will result in growth mindset especially for\nthe technology sectors and tie to prosperity leading to increased\nhappiness, which what human mind chases, largely speaking.\n\nS&P 500 Index: The S&P 500 Index is a stock market index tracking the\nperformance of 500 large publicly traded companies in the U.S. It is\nwidely regarded as a key indicator of overall market health and economic\nperformance.\n\nMarkets: Looking back in the last 12 months, S&P 500 Index experienced\nsignificant growth, reflecting strong market performance. From July 2023\nto July 2024, the index rose from 4,450.38 to approximately 5,460.48,\nmarking an increase of about 22.7%.\n\nSo why did the index grow despite the high interest rates?\n\nThe \\\"Magnificent 7\\\" stocks, comprising Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta\nPlatforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, have played a substantial role\nin the S&P 500\\'s performance over the past year. These seven companies,\ncollectively known as the Mag 7, account for nearly a third of the S&P\n500\\'s market capitalization. Their combined influence has been\nsignificant, driving much of the index\\'s growth.\n\nIn 2023, the Mag 7 stocks surged by approximately 75%, while the\nremaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 rose by only 12%. This stark\ncontrast highlights the outsized impact these tech giants have had on\nthe overall market. Without the contribution of the Mag 7, the S&P\n500\\'s performance would have been markedly lower.\n\nFor example, Nvidia led the charge with a remarkable 239% increase in\n2023, followed by Meta Platforms with a 191% gain.\n\nMonopolies: This disproportionate growth also shows how monopolies will\ncome into play. NVIDIA makes H100 GPUs worth \\$30k a piece. A lot of\nAI/ML infrastructure will have hard reference to their architecture.\n\nWe also experienced global outages in banks, airlines, finance, retail\nand other industries owing to issues related to Microsoft/Crowdstrike\ndominance.\n\nIn a Nutshell disproportionality of nations are now also reflected in\ncompanies. For now, just be aware, observe and appreciate these\nphenomenon"

    "content": "Last set of thoughts with this phase of life as a 'Snowflake'. Sundays\nare not going to stop and so are the thoughts not going to stop. This\nweekend has been a deeply introspective 48 hour window.\n\nINCREMENTALISM: Writing this one with a perspective of an investment\nanalogy. India runs a campaign called 'Mutual Funds Sahi Hai' and there\nis an attached strategy of a Systematic Investment Plan. Largely, unless\nyou are an F&O (Futures and Options) player, you will invest with a long\nterm in perspective. Essential difference between a Fixed Deposit and\nLong Term investments is a combination of fluid model, long term tenure\nand the (dis)proportionality of results, of course there is always an\nelement of risk. Let's take this game to our personal lives.\n\nSystematic Investment Plans involve regular periodic investment of a\ncertain capacity to invest in the form of money or efforts. Similar to\nfinancial investments, effort investments need to be fixed and\ncontinuous. This is the magic of incrementalism.\n\nYou need a very predictable investment in learning a skill, bringing\nawareness of worldly realities, applying the skill/knowledge and driving\nfor measurable results/outcomes.\n\nDANGERS OF INCREMENTALISM: When you chase for a certain increment (pun\nintended) or a promotion, you tend to put outcomes ahead of efforts and\nthis leads to gratifying short term gains and long term disappointments,\nunless of course that brings happiness.\n\nThe key difference here is to state that investments have to be\nincremental. In order to have non-linear returns, outcomes or\nexpectations need not be either short term or just incremental.\nDisruptions or Transformations happen only with a long lasting\nperseverance, whether it is to do with building an LLM or discovering a\ncure for cancer.\n\nACUMEN and TIMING : Acumen is a function of knowing where to invest, how\nmuch to invest and appreciating Return on Investments at the right time.\nYou need returns to buy a house, for educational loans or to make bigger\ninvestments for the future.\n\nAcumen to know where to invest money or efforts has to be very selective\nand to not follow someone's lead blindly. This needs a solid awareness\nof goals first, navigational path to source knowledge, execution\nframework and of course a support structure to lean for guidance.\n\nAnother thought that came my way, especially over the weekend as I\npursue my next phase in the journey, is this one critical question.\nWhose Inbox do I exist in, e-mail or mental? Once you have made your\ninvestments, gained incremental knowledge over time, and generated\nreturns/value, now is the time to look for compounding effects. With\nfinance you need a new investment model and with professional drive, you\nneed to know who you know or rather who knows you? Do you navigate to be\npresent in their mental or electronic inbox (e-mail)? Compounding does\nnot happen without this, your knowledge will stagnate with you without\nbeing able to navigate and communicate.\n\nThere are many ways to arrive in someone's mental inbox which I will\nwrite about at a future point.\n\nCONCLUDING: Are you looking for that F&O like iPhone perk from a new\nopportunity or building a long term corpus? Remember, in ROI there are\nno returns before the investments. So do you have an SIP? Whose Inbox\nare you in?\n\nIf you would like to continue receiving these thoughts just drop a note\non my LinkedIn inbox with a preferred email address to receive these."

He continues\nto work on what the future holds.\n\nNot so talked about and relatively new initiatives from Musk include\nNeuralink - built to alleviate human suffering while expanding\ncapabilities of human mind, Optimus - the Humanoid Robot, desire to\nbuild a human colony on planet Mars and finally the buildout of\n'Gigafactory of Compute', the world's largest supercomputer.\n\nBuildout of 'Gigafactory of Compute' is 750,000 sq ft in Memphis, state\nof Tennessee and is on an accelerated timeline to complete in 2025. This\nsupercomputer involves 100,000 GPUs which are all connected to each such\nthat a GPU can talk to any of the other GPUs in the cluster. This likely\nrepresents a human brain that humans can actually see, analogically\nspeaking. Similar to the human brain, gray matter is represented by\ncompute blocks and cables connecting the GPUs represent the tissues of\nthe white matter. Human brain has 60% white matter which is equivalent\nto cables and these cables similar to the tissues are responsible for\ncarrying signals inside the brain.\n\nSo, why compare the Supercomputer buildout with the brain?\n\nTo achieve AGI/ASI (Artificial General/Superhuman Intelligence), we will\nneed access to extraordinary computing capacity.\n\nAdditionally, the AGI buildout supercomputer will also support\nNeuralink.

    "content": "Questioning the Definitions:\n\nToday, I am writing about how I questioned some definitions to\nunderstand a few recent concepts. Here we go.\n\nImagine you are doing a 'Subject Matter' talk or a presentation. In\npreparation you have a structure based on a flow or your knowledge based\non which you have prepared your talk.\n\nWhat makes a Tech Deterministic or Non Deterministic?\n\nDeterministic Tech produces the same output for a given input every\ntime. Traditional algorithms and rule based software follow specific\ninstructions and provide predictable results.\n\nLLMs are trained on a variety of data sets and the inference or\nresponses of the model rely on probabilistic algorithms to generate\nresponses. Given that token generation is sequential (100th word of the\ninference is not predicted till the 99th word is generated), LLMs\ngenerate varied and creative responses for each 'ask' just like a human\nbrain would.\n\nAs a presenter: In the mock of being a presenter you have studied your\nsubject for years and this makes your talk super predictable in the\ncontext of your preparation and material to be shared.\n\nWhy do the models hallucinate in that case?\n\nModels respond to training data and not factual accuracy so it makes\nthem predictive, leading to incorrect or nonsensical responses. They\ncannot make real-time verification and hence just like a human would (we\nall sometimes say nonsensical things) model would do the same.\n\nNow when you are reciting tables of mathematical numbers you are always\nreferring to some verification or validation so you will not tend to\nhallucinate due to finite factual references, unless of course you are\nmaking a genuine mistake.\n\nAs a presenter: Now imagine that in this session someone asks you a\nquestion and you are not sure of the answer. You may answer it\nsubjectively with some abstraction or defer the question saying that you\nwill come back at a later point.\n\nFundamental nature of LLMs is poised to be an accurate specialist and as\na result unlike human responses, language models may hallucinate and\ngive an incorrect response. Imagine how many people will come back to\nyour 'specialist' talk if you hallucinated and said 'sorry' let me try\nthis again.\n\nSimilar to answering mathematical questions, how can models be made more\naccurate or more deterministic?\n\nModels can be improved with techniques like Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) where the models retrieve relevant, up-to-date\ninformation from external sources before generating a response. This\nensures fact-based responses from being trained on a specialized\ndataset. This will mitigate hallucination and provide far more\ntrustworthy outputs.\n\nAs a presenter: In this situation, many times leaders take along\nspecialists and use them similar to RAGs to provide qualified responses\nafter providing initial directional thoughts.\n\nSo What? In your pursuit of life, you need solid subject matters to be\n'out there' that come from training and many instances of responsive\ninferences. You will often get stuck and you will need to better prepare\nto infer (imagine at meetings), to respond (show up), to reduce\nhallucinations (keep mum when you are not sure), to train yourself (find\nwhere you fell short) and finally use support (of experts and your\ncolleagues) to make an impact. Do you?"

    "content": "Understanding the Recent Economic Turmoil\n\nCarry Trade: A carry trade involves borrowing money in a currency with a\nlow-interest rate and investing it in a currency or asset with a higher\ninterest rate, profiting from the difference (the \\\"carry\\\"). This was\nevident in the recent findings as many investors borrowed from almost 0%\ninterest Japanese Yen and invested in high yield assets, especially ones\nattached with the US dollars.\n\nFollowing chart shows how the median population has trended in 3 of the\ngeographies, namely India, Japan and the United States that I considered\nfor this write-up. As you can say, the current median age of the\nJapanese population is significantly higher than that of the United\nStates and much higher than that of India.\n\n![](media/image22.png){width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.25in\"}\n\nLet's also look at the ratio of national debt to GDP ratio for these\ncountries\n\n![](media/image21.png){width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.194444444444445in\"}\n\nIn a nutshell, you see that the debt for the United States and Japan, as\ncompared to the GDP, has significantly grown and remains unmanaged.\n\nSo, what? This essentially shows that between the aging population, cost\nof servicing the debt and inflationary impacts both Japan and the US\nhave an uphill battle to run their economies. If not corrected,\ncountries like India will have a similar outcome in 2 decades from now.\n\nWhat triggered the global economy in the last 2 weeks?\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Bank of Japan decided to raise its interest rates to\n0.15-0.25% from 0%, for the first time in years to curb rising inflation\nand stabilize the yen.\n\nGoing back to carry trade, the borrowed capital in form of Japanese yen,\nnow becomes expensive. As the governments would service the debt, your\nneed to serve the loan payment for borrowing in Japanese Yen now has an\ninterest payment and an additional economic uncertainty from any future\nrate increases.\n\nIf this was borrowed at 0% and invested in the US bonds at 4-5% you are\nmaking roughly an annual gain of \\$40,000-\\$50,0000 against a borrowing\nof 1 million dollar equivalent. The larger organizations who use this\nleverage are interested in a lot more than 4-5% gain. Their game is much\nbigger. How?\n\n-   Now imagine that borrowings are much larger in billions\n\n-   Borrowings are against collaterals like assets and equities\n\n-   Borrowed money is then further leveraged to invest the borrowings in\n    > F&O (Futures & Options). Simply stating, the borrowed capital is\n    > invested in proportionately much larger investments than the loans\n\n-   Now, all of a sudden when the Bank of Japan announced this raise in\n    > the interest rate, there is a rush to cover for making the loan\n    > payments both in actual and speculative modes\n\n-   This rush creates a pressure on all the asset classes including real\n    > estate and equities. As you can imagine, equities are much easier\n    > to exit from than other fixed asset classes\n\n-   F&O algorithms resulted in a very aggressive sell-off of equities\n    > worth billions \\$.\n\n-   Hence you see a mode where there are significantly more sellers than\n    > buyers (beautifully explained by Nilesh Shah at Kotak Bank\n    > -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY8sXX-QKME)\n\n-   You saw a major sell-off in the global markets as a result\n\nSeeing this major sell off and uncertainty, the Bank of Japan decides to\nhold on to increasing the raise in the interest rates. What were they\nthinking?\n\nMarkets have stabilized since then although the uncertainty of\nmacroeconomic situations still holds and on a separate note, there is a\nlooming danger of the United States entering in the recessionary mode.\n\nWhat is in it for me/you?\n\nRecession in the US will impact the world and the attached ripples will\nbe experienced by all of us. This will create both opportunities and\nrepositioning needs for your personal portfolios. Will the reversal of\ndecision by the Bank of Japan lead back to the 'same old same old'\nborrowing. Keep your eyes and ears open. This will impact all of our\nlives where we live in this globally connected/impacting world."

    "content": "What does your week look like?\n\nMost of us 'working professionals' are trained to start the work week on\nMondays, check on things to do for the day or the week and just jump\nstart. For those who are super apprehensive about the food chain\nsentiment, our work emotions are driven by the boss' mood swings, her\nagenda or sometimes we rejoice from them not being around for the week.\nWe have a finite set of choices to begin the week or the day. Comfort\nleads to this Auto-pilot. A week may also have intersperses of workout,\nbreaks, and family routines. Week ends somewhere between Thursday,\nFriday or Saturday and then there is some unwinding before the cycle\nresets for yet another Monday.\n\nSo, Why this?\n\nSome people love the predictability of life. For me especially, 'change'\nis far more comforting than routine. Our routine life also needs\ndiscipline, however this will keep you cruising and just let you be. I\nwant to address the requirement of intensity to discover the next\nversion of us. The growth mindset.\n\nImportance of 'Change'\n\nEnvironment around us goes through constant changes, some of them are\nsignificant life changing events. Think of how life has changed and\nchallenged us through the covid pandemic, the following supply chain\ncrisis, government intervention through stimulus, economic growth, major\npolicy changes to manage inflationary and disinflationary impacts, the\nwars, the energy and the weather crisis and of course, the evolution of\nAI/LLMs. These events have forced changes in our work environments,\nlifestyle choices from being stuck at home and riding the associated\n'monetary' tidal waves.\n\nOne part of me wants to learn and appreciate the changes and the other\npart is to change myself. You can be a change catalyst in two ways.\nFirstly, appreciate above events and make changes to your work and life\nmodels: we learnt how to work remotely to where we have reached hybrid\nwork styles, we leverage the AI and new-age tech tools to accelerate our\nwork journeys, we made investments to leverage major geopolitical or\nmacroeconomic events and lastly but most importantly to recognize the\nimportance of human life and health from the perils of the wars and the\npandemic.\n\nSecondly, in addition to leveraging these changes in our existing life,\nlife itself can change through these. Disruption in the hospitality\nbusiness with AirBnB, Full Service Autonomous vehicles, Media\nconsumption through OTT streaming compared to traditional cable\nconnections and dreaming to colonize Mars would not be possible without\nthis mindset to change the world.\n\nTwo thoughts in conclusion\n\n-   Effort is everything: World around us moves very fast and if you\n    > want to sit there thinking that you are better than man of the\n    > worst performers then you will keep cruising\n\n-   Wandering Mindset: I came across this Ted talk that shows how to\n    > 'hack your brain for better focus', you need not just workout or\n    > meditate but also let your mind wander from a thought to a\n    > thought. It will bring a much needed breadth.\n    > <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBaFURjVrm0>\n\nSo, are you ready for a change as the new Monday begins tomorrow?"

    "content": "Matters Of Mind\n\nMany of my wellwishers suggested that I take a break this time around. I\nhave been working for over three decades and have never taken a break in\nbetween my jobs. So, for the first time, I am on a break. At any given\npoint either, I am rejuvenating or anxious. Rejuvenating to recharge or\nanxious to think about what's next? Should I be recharging or just stay\nbusy looking for my next career opportunity? Honestly, I think this one\nneeds a placebo.\n\nChange your mindset, change your game\n\nI came across [this](https://youtu.be/0tqq66zwa7g?si=0eoeA_Wp6u5HeROI)\nted talk by Dr Alia Crum where she shares how our thinking determines\nour body's response. She shares four beautiful illustrations showing\npositive psychological and physiological responses from placebo's effect\non patients, love for their job by the housekeeping staff from exercise\nbenefits of their work, ghrelin level drop from description of how the\nmilkshake was made as low calorie sugar free recipe vs. high fat high\ncalorie recipe, and lastly how dealing with stress leads to peak\nperformance.\n\nIn case you are not aware, the placebo effect occurs when a person\nexperiences a perceived improvement in their condition after receiving a\ntreatment with no therapeutic value, driven by their belief in the\ntreatment\\'s efficacy.\n\nGhrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite, increases food intake,\nand promotes fat storage, often called the \\\"hunger hormone\\\" because it\nsignals the brain to induce feelings of hunger.\n\nSo, Why this?\n\nOne of my readers asked me to write about the 'perceived' value of the\nwork we do.\n\nSimilar to Dr Crum, let's think about four possible situations:\n\n1.  First, let's imagine that there is no recognition or appreciation of\n    > what you do. Zero. Nada.\n\n2.  Manager and Management is deeply appreciative however you are\n    > unsure. So you think that you are not appreciated as there is no\n    > acknowledgement.\n\n3.  You get recognition and appreciation from the leadership, all the\n    > time. This keeps you elated and makes you really happy about the\n    > work you do, just like the housekeeping staff knowing that they\n    > exercise regularly by the virtue of doing their job.\n\n4.  In the last instance, even if you receive real or 'sugar coated'\n    > acknowledgement of the work you do, you are self-aware and\n    > self-critical of the work that you do. You believe and have strong\n    > awareness of your ability to move the needle.\n\nWhich situation would you rather be in, of the four of the above. Some\nof you may want situations 3 & 4 both and most evolved individuals would\nlook for only #4.\n\nSo let's conclude with the 'Matters of Mind'\n\n-   While there is no suggestion to not exercise or to not follow the\n    > diet, our psychological and physiological states are definitely\n    > influenced by the mind.\n\n-   Should I be having fun in my sabbatical or be anxious for my work?\n    > Neither - just be cognitively aware of both the pockets\n\n-   Should I always be stressed as it gives me peak performance? Not\n    > quite, just be aware that stress is not always a bad thing\n\n-   Lastly, imagine you are (like me) looking for a new opportunity,\n    > would you rather be in #4 of the 4 situations or tell about your\n    > value to the outside world only based on the validation from your\n    > food chain."

    "content": "Spend Spectrum, Cost of Living Adjustments and Purchasing Price Parities\n\nA friend of mine from Mumbai met me today in Lonavala, which is a\nrelative mid-point between my house in Pune and Mumbai. Since we were\nmeeting with families after a very long time gap, we decided to go to a\nfancy wine & dine place. I had called for a driver to drive us so that\nwe could enjoy our drink and drive home peacefully. Upon return, I asked\nmy driver how much I owed him for his lunch as I wanted to pay him\nallowance for his meal and more. He said that was about 100 Rupees\n(\\$1.20).\n\nI was humbled by two things: His honesty as a first thing. Secondly, how\ncost effective his meal was compared to the embarrassment it would cause\nfor me to write how much we spent on our lunch.\n\nIn another situation, I wanted to buy a recliner for my TV room a few\nyears ago. I went to a fancy European furniture store and the saleswoman\ntried to sell me this expensive recliner chair which was a little more\nexpensive than a modest sedan car one could purchase. She told me even\nKartik Aryan, a celebratory Indian film star, has this recliner. I had\nno idea of who Kartik Aryan was and irrespective of that I decided to\npurchase a cost effective option. The Danish option of the recliner was\nto be made to order and handmade in Denmark, which obviously would\ninvolve both meticulous quality and cost of European labor.\n\nAs you move from the Northern Europe to the Southern Europe to some\nAsian countries and eventually to the South Asian subcontinent you will\nexperience the purchasing price parities, spend spectrums and cost of\nliving adjustment with unit costs coming down as you pan through the\nchronology of these geographies, as described.\n\nSo, What? How does this similarly impact the rest of the world?\n\nAs I write this, Volkswagen company (VW), a parent auto-manufacturing\ncompany of brands including VW, Skoda, Audi and Porsche, is considering\nshutting its manufacturing plants in Germany. Between the pandemic, the\nsupply chain crisis, and the Russia-Ukraine war the European and German\neconomy especially have been hit hard. (Dis)parities exist between\nEurope and Asia as well as between Northern and Southern EU nations.\n\nBetween the rising costs of labor, factory ecosystem in Europe and\nthreats from China based EV companies, VW's business is threatened. VW\ncan't sell as much in China anymore, EVs made in China are imported to\nEurope and most importantly even the VW's China made EVs are levied 38%\nimport duty in Europe. All this has made the business harder for VW.\n\nSo what does VW do? They decide to shut their German plants down and\nplan to reduce expenses by \\$11B in the next 2 years. This will have\nimplications - firstly, it will directly impact the employment and GDP\nin Germany. VW is just a symptomatic representation of what is happening\nwith other companies and EU countries as well. Possibly the negative\ngrowth movements will lead to a recessionary state of additional Western\ncountries including the United States.\n\nGovernments and Federal Banks are under extreme pressures to reduce\ninterest rates to keep their economies afloat.\n\nGlobal Capability Centers (GCCs) in India\n\nThese situations of shifting workloads out of Europe creates\nopportunities for the world to draw some balance. GCCs, which many of\nyou are part of, represent 1%+ of India's GDP and this contribution from\nthe GCCs continues to grow. There will be opportunities to build more\ntechnology, design, and manufacturing units in cost effective\ngeographies. This will need the governments to offer increasing ease for\ndoing businesses, gain political stability, industries to create talent,\nassure quality and get ready?\n\nYour takeaway from this is to firstly acknowledge the global\nrecessionary sentiments, impacts and opportunities this will create and\nplunge in when the opportunity knocks your door. Of course you will need\nto dress up in overalls, roll up your sleeves and be ready. Are you?"

    "content": "'Internal' Neuralink: Connecting with your mind\n\nNeuralink, an Elon Musk company, is building a brain-computer interface that can bypass damaged neural pathways and facilitate direct communication between the brain and external devices.\n\nI came across two really great talks and picked a third from my past life to connect a few dots. What if there was a linkage mechanism like Neuralink that can super-accelerate your connection and engagement with the external world. I am sure that there are thousands of such talks, however my intention at this point is just to provoke thoughts in order to achieve this acceleration.\n\n1. Your body language may shape who you are (24 Minutes)\n\nAmy in this talk mentions \"power posing,\" where adopting expansive, confident postures for two minutes can boost feelings of power and reduce stress. It raises your testosterone and reduces your cortisol. You fake and infuse confidence in your posing and thinking not just to make it but to become it. This authentic change will foster personal growth and empowerment. This internal wiring and preparedness can then leverage your body posture and expressions to further make seamless engagement with the external world. How?\n\n2. You are (or can be) Contagious When you meet a person first, what do you look at? Face, Shoes or Body. Not quite, they look at your hands first. Your hands speak a lot - a hawk, a defender or someone who welcomes. Now I figured what it meant to welcome with open arms. They look at whether you are holding a rock, scissor or welcome/warmth. If you can't see someone's hands you can't see her intentions. Greatest of the Ted speakers use 465 hand gestures in 18 minutes. Your brain gives 12.5x weightage to other people's hand gestures. Our implied and expressed emotions, fears and intentions are contagious. When you smile artificially with just your mouth open and naturally with your mouth open stretching your cheeks all the way to your eyes, you look more welcoming. Try it. Lastly when you speak what matters is the deep rooted tone of your intentions. All in all to accelerate your messaging to the outside world, from the thoughts so far, your power posing matters and then you exponentiate that with your niceness. The magic continues.\n\n3. The Problem With Being \"Too Nice\"\n\nNow when people speak, you can know easily when people are being nice artificially or naturally. When someone speaks about your shoes or your attire, you can most always tell how much of that is natural or artificial. What does one want to hear?\n\nThe spoken feedback loop is also a very difficult layer to lay over your posture and expressive niceness. Imagine an interpersonal dance when we give and receive feedback. Tough feedback without honesty and nicety creates discomfort in the recipient's body language. Shrunk body or pulled back chair. It is a lot easier to give general feedback: You did great, keep doing what you are doing, I love your sense of humor and a lot more while actually not giving honest feedback. Imagine, someone at your work tells you to take more initiative. Whatever that means - lord save me at that point.\n\nTry to be honest and tough at first. Start with the positive part of the content (you did great, the topic was awesome, your confidence was very high), move to the net neutral aspects next (you could have changed the order, used a different font or a more impactful set of words) and finally lean into the constructive part. Recommend replacement behaviors: You talked about a great topic although you could have provided a course of action. They did not walk away with the understanding that you had intended to convey…. I am sure there is more.\n\nTake away from here: You see that the whole process of impactfully engaging with the external world is and can be very cyclical. Your inner wiring, your body language, your warmth, your message and the construct of it. The feedback loop too. I am amazed at how we exist. Take feedback from people you work with and find out if they see you as a package or if you see a package somewhere in someone.\n\nAs always, do write back and share your feedback. Let me know what else I can think about."

This is what it looked like definitionally\n\nNDP = C + R + I + (X - A) where\n\n-   NDP => Network Development Plan\n\n-   C => Content (Largely the Accomplishments)\n\n-   R => Relationships (People in your Life)\n\n-   I => Investments (Intellectual Growth & Support)\n\n-   X => X Factor (Accelerators)\n\n-   A => Abscondment (De-Accelerators)\n\nNow the labels.\n\nFirst 90 Days\n\nIf you are in the first 90 days of a job, a business, a relationship or any kind of personal journey, you focus on the first impressions made, learning about your environment, first set of goals, defining a structure for success, coalition/befriending, making an impactful presence and most importantly avoiding any boo-boos.\n\nPrevious 90 Days & Next 90 Days\n\nAt the beginning of the new 90-day window, you look back at two important aspects of the 'Network Development Plan' components: The X Factor and Abscondments. X Factors will allow you to ensure continuous growth with accelerators and awareness of abscondment will keep you cognitively aware.\n\nAs you plan for your next 90 days, know of your big chunks (Content), Coalition/Befriending (Relationship) and Investments (Intellectual Growth). Set aside time to think of breakthroughs you will accomplish as part of your X factor.\n\nAs humans, we tend to gratify ourselves from efforts in the past compared to the outcomes from the past. This is a trap which can slow you down. Of course, you must always celebrate success.\n\nLast (Ending) 90 Days\n\nWhen you begin to end something, you complete your assignments, do a very effective and honest handover and know that you are not burning a bridge of the past. Sometimes you need these bridges as part of your future journeys. You are leaving a brand and a legacy behind. Imagine as a departing leader of a nation, what your last actions can constitute.\n\nSomeone else's first 90 Days\n\nThis is where your X-Factor can come into play to help others in arriving gracefully. This is where you can build relationships and trust. You will enable both the individual and the organization. Schmooze respectfully.\n\nTakeaways\n\nSimilar to a nation's GDP, your Personal or Network Development Plan is a function of 90-day chunks. You will have X Factors that will provide accelerators and growth, always seek for them. Remember, two-quarters of negative growth leads to a recession: repetitive abscondments will make you recessionary.\n\nDo you know your 90-day chunks? Are you growing enough or you are recessionary? Do you have a recovery plan? Lastly, growth has to adjust for inflation and goals need to grow larger. Make it fun."

How long does it take? How do you deal with\nadversaries in the process? This is the story of Argentina in the last\n12 months and the greatest of the economic reforms that took place under\nthe leadership of Javier Milei, president of Argentina. In November '23,\nMilei won decisively with 56% of the vote, marking a seismic shift in\nArgentina's political landscape in favor of Milei's unconventional style\nand promises of sweeping reform. What evolved in the year from thereon\nwill be etched in the history books.\n\nIn a capitalistic society, you aim to provide good quality goods for\nyour citizens at a good price point. According to Milei, you are either\na socialist economy or one that is capitalist, everything that is in\nbetween is a neoclassical trap.\n\n**Drivers that led to Reformation of Captilasitc Argentinian Economy**\n\n-   Milei approached to eliminate monopolies and concentrated economic\n    > structures.

This led to elimination of thousands\n    > of redundant jobs\n\n-   Inflation subsequently reduced from 54% annually to a much desirable\n    > number of close to 2%\n\n**How do you fight with the forces within the nation?**\n\nTo have been in a leadership position meant fighting with the\nadversaries whether they are the opposing politicians, corruption or the\nlopsided media houses. Here are some highlights\n\n-   Before Millei, Argentina faced 900 roadblocks a year. Its citizens\n    > were paid to participate in the roadblocks and attacks. By the\n    > virtue of elimination of the poverty managers and other\n    > bureaucrats, many intermediaries were eliminated at first\n\n-   Citizens participating in roadblocks were barred from receiving\n    > poverty benefits and some were jailed\n\n-   Aggressive reduction and removal of public works agencies reduced\n    > obscured accounting and uncontrollable spends\n\n-   Corrupt officials were jailed and their pensions were taken away\n\n-   The judiciary was further empowered to make decisions\n\n-   Regulatory powers were taken away from politicians, companies and\n    > power groups to create a true capitalist and competitive landscape\n\n-   Social Media and other media platforms were leveraged to reduce the\n    > influence of corrupt journalists\n\n**Governance in Capitalistic Societies**\n\nSome things that came to my mind to draw corollaries\n\n-   For nations to become successful and growth-oriented, leadership is\n    > the key. The economic brilliance of Javier Milei helped the way.\n    > Leadership teams matter a lot\n\n-   Picking a cue from Argentina and the large debt of \\$35T+ in\n    > perspective, the United States has initiated a brand new\n    > initiative to set the foundation effective January 25 in the form\n    > of the creation of DOGE, Department of Government Efficiency.

Looking forward to hearing from you all on\nwhat other insights you may have.\n\nI was inspired to write from this [[Lex Friedman podcast with Javier\nMillei]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/8NLzc9kobDk?si=IdF9rosvgaVGf4DG),\nwhich was a truly intriguing experience for me.\n\n**Nov 25, 2024**\n\n**Magic of 90**\n\nFollowing the US election drama in the last few weeks, I wondered what\nit must feel like to be in the transition phase of about 2.5 months\nbetween the announcement of the result and the actual point in time when\nthe new president-elect moves into office. When both the leader and the\nruling party change, there will be many opportunity windows.\n\n-   For the departing leader, to implement the last set of desirable\n    > actions\n\n-   For the arriving leader, to start defining the canvas of the new\n    > term roadmap and\n\n-   Most importantly, for the arriving leader to understand the impact\n    > of the departing leader's actions on the new term roadmap\n\nStakes are very high in such transitions. It made me realize that all of\nour lives, personal and professional, can be managed as chunks keeping\nsimilar perspectives.

Make it fun.\n\n**Nov 18, 2024**\n\n**\\\n'Internal' Neuralink: Connecting with your mind**\n\nNeuralink, an Elon Musk company, is building a brain-computer interface\nthat can bypass damaged neural pathways and facilitate direct\ncommunication between the brain and external devices.\n\nI came across two really great talks and picked a third from my past\nlife to connect a few dots. What if there was a linkage mechanism like\nNeuralink that can super-accelerate your connection and engagement with\nthe external world. I am sure that there are thousands of such talks,\nhowever my intention at this point is just to provoke thoughts in order\nto achieve this acceleration.\n\n# [**[1. Your body language may shape who you are (24 Minutes)]{.underline}**](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_may_shape_who_you_are?subtitle=en) \n\nAmy in this talk mentions \\\"power posing,\\\" where adopting expansive,\nconfident postures for two minutes can boost feelings of power and\nreduce stress. It raises your testosterone and reduces your cortisol.\nYou fake and infuse confidence in your posing and thinking not just to\nmake it but to become it. This authentic change will foster personal\ngrowth and empowerment. This internal wiring and preparedness can then\nleverage your body posture and expressions to further make seamless\nengagement with the external world. How?\n\n[**[2. You are (or can be)\nContagious]{.underline}**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cef35Fk7YD8)\nWhen you meet a person first, what do you look at? Face, Shoes or Body.\nNot quite, they look at your hands first. Your hands speak a lot - a\nhawk, a defender or someone who welcomes. Now I figured what it meant to\nwelcome with open arms. They look at whether you are holding a rock,\nscissor or welcome/warmth. If you can't see someone's hands you can't\nsee her intentions. Greatest of the Ted speakers use 465 hand gestures\nin 18 minutes. Your brain gives 12.5x weightage to other people\\'s hand\ngestures. Our implied and expressed emotions, fears and intentions are\ncontagious. When you smile artificially with just your mouth open and\nnaturally with your mouth open stretching your cheeks all the way to\nyour eyes, you look more welcoming. Try it. Lastly when you speak what\nmatters is the deep rooted tone of your intentions. All in all to\naccelerate your messaging to the outside world, from the thoughts so\nfar, your power posing matters and then you exponentiate that with your\nniceness. The magic continues.\n\n# [**[3. The Problem With Being \"Too Nice\"]{.underline}**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrCbXNRP7eg&t=76s) \n\nNow when people speak, you can know easily when people are being nice\nartificially or naturally. When someone speaks about your shoes or your\nattire, you can most always tell how much of that is natural or\nartificial. What does one want to hear?\n\nThe spoken feedback loop is also a very difficult layer to lay over your\nposture and expressive niceness. Imagine an interpersonal dance when we\ngive and receive feedback. Tough feedback without honesty and nicety\ncreates discomfort in the recipient's body language. Shrunk body or\npulled back chair. It is a lot easier to give general feedback: You did\ngreat, keep doing what you are doing, I love your sense of humor and a\nlot more while actually not giving honest feedback. Imagine, someone at\nyour work tells you to take more initiative. Whatever that means - lord\nsave me at that point.\n\nTry to be honest and tough at first. Start with the positive part of the\ncontent (you did great, the topic was awesome, your confidence was very\nhigh), move to the net neutral aspects next (you could have changed the\norder, used a different font or a more impactful set of words) and\nfinally lean into the constructive part. Recommend replacement\nbehaviors: You talked about a great topic although you could have\nprovided a course of action. They did not walk away with the\nunderstanding that you had intended to convey.... I am sure there is\nmore.\n\n**Take away from here:** You see that the whole process of impactfully\nengaging with the external world is and can be very cyclical. Your inner\nwiring, your body language, your warmth, your message and the construct\nof it. The feedback loop too. I am amazed at how we exist. Take feedback\nfrom people you work with and find out if they see you as a package or\nif you see a package somewhere in someone.\n\nAs always, do write back and share your feedback. Let me know what else\nI can think about.\n\n**Nov 11, 2024**\n\nSomehow magically, the last few weeks have been focused on thought\nleadership and following my thoughts on 'Schmoozing', I got 20% of\nreaders writing back to me with their perspectives.\n\nTwo more perspectives on that note for today: A reader asked me to write\nabout Competing vs. Collaborating. Separately and secondly, I met a\nbunch of highly accomplished families in California who were discussing\ntheir thoughts behind education and making investments for the next\ngeneration. Perhaps there is a convergence on both the topics at the\ntail of my message today.\n\n**Competitive vs. Collaborative Colleagues**\n\nWe often get impacted by competitive colleagues. Aggressive competitive\nmindset can be demonstrated by a combination of schmoozing, blowing your\ntrumpet, 'I did this' stories, undermining others' ideas, withholding\ninformation, dominating conversations and exaggerating mistakes of\nothers. Largely extroverted and bombastic behaviors.\n\nOn the other hand, individuals who are collaborators and wanting to work\nwith others will have the 'we did it' mindset, recognize efforts as a\nteam, allow people to speak, help others to prepare and cover up for\nothers' mistakes.\n\n**Investing for the Next Generation**\n\nWe often worry about rising costs of academia irrespective of whether\nyou have young children, 'ready to attend college' children or for some\nof you who are trying to get additional specialized education. One of\nthe colleagues at the dinner also mentioned that we need to prepare for\nthe cost of weddings of our children and perhaps even a down payment for\ntheir new home. I was flabbergasted.\n\nOften as a parent or for self, we will aim to stretch and spend\nhandsomely on education. Many of the undergrad programs in the United\nStates cost \\$400,000 over 4 years. You have seen similar costs in your\ngeography or for your programs. Given that financial abilities vary, I\nwould suggest to not stretch beyond your means to educate yourself or\nyour dependents and to not make them dependent on your financial\nposition for a fancy wedding or a house payment.\n\nIn all situations competence is what matters. These individuals that\nshared commitments for education, marriage or properties all had\nconverged to technology, of course we are in the Silicon Valley for this\ninstance. They came from diverse backgrounds like being a nutritionist,\naerospace engineer or an MBA.\n\nFormal education certainly provides the baseline. Navigation in the real\nworld, unknown to many of us, is purely through building competence.\n\n**Competence: Superseding 'Formal' Academia or Competitive vs.\nCollaborative Mindset**\n\nCompetence is largely built as a function of cognizance (awareness) and\nperseverance. Here is a checklist\n\n-   Identify the problems and opportunities that exist\n\n-   You identify the most challenging initiatives that bring you outside\n    > of your comfort zone\n\n-   Learn and develop skills to solve these difficult problems\n\n-   Look for cost effective relevant and alternate training mechanisms\n    > to develop skills in adjacency. Basic formal education is required\n    > that should not create a long term debt\n\n-   Stay ahead with industry insights\n\n-   Be an effective listener and make decisive contributions\n\n-   Voice assertive opinions with facts\n\n-   Outpace deadlines and targets. Seek help from influential team\n    > members to collaborate\n\n-   Be open to receiving and providing constructive criticism\n\n-   Communicate accomplishments with facts and celebrate often\n\nObviously there is more to this list, so I am always looking forward to\nhearing your thoughts and ideas.\n\n**Nov 4, 2024**\n\n**How to be a Schmoozer?**\n\nLet's define a 'Schmoozer' first: This is a person who is a sweet talker\nand can very easily persuade others to do what she wants. This skill is\nespecially important to manage your food chain.\n\nI was with some friends and like how we talk about teaching life skills\nat schools and colleges, a colleague of mine, of course with great\nintentions, suggested that one thing that people need to be taught is to\nbe a good 'schmoozer'. I immediately responded and reacted to say, this\nis not required. I do not support schmoozing or 'kissing up', crudely\nspeaking.\n\n**Let the Truth prevail**\n\nIn the long run schmoozing can get you somewhere and may also give you\nall the wealth and success. You need to ask the question to know what\nmatters to you. I often speak about authentic communication that\ninvolves honesty, openness and objectivity, applicable at all levels.\nWhether you are speaking with your team, your peers or your leadership,\nauthenticity matters.\n\nWhen you are dealing with a dilemma of communicating via 'schmooze' or\n'truth', especially with people who hold greater influence, ensure you\ntake care of a few things. Firstly know the path of communicating the\nfacts, know the choices and the impact or outcomes from each of the\nchoices. Also, it is important to find the right setup and place to\ncommunicate, ideal 1:1, so that you have minimized the points of\ncomplexity when being courageous when sharing thoughts and ideas.\n\n-   Ensure that you have thoroughly thought about all options and that\n    > you are thinking outside the box. Thinking inside the box to\n    > schmooze is easy\n\n-   Ensure that you have moved from comfort of conformity inside the box\n    > to outside the box\n\n-   You will risk your reputation outside the box however the long term\n    > rewards are far superior\n\n-   Discomforted mental state in these situations is very normal\n\n-   To be divergent you will need to cross the border of your mind. This\n    > needs long thinking which is different from fast, deep or\n    > brilliant thinking. What does this mean? It necessitates\n    > exploration of options and the attached value of each of the\n    > options\n\nImagine you are innovating for your organization. You need many inputs\nfrom multiple entities inside and outside your organization, you reach\nout to people who have the strong ability to express and then create a\nplatform for these disparate inputs to converge.\n\nIn a nutshell, you know if you are a schmoozer or an impact leader. If\nyou believe that you are selective or balanced about being both then\nthink hard. Of course, communication requires safety for both the sender\nand the recipient of the information. What are your experiences and\nthoughts? Happy to hear back.\n\nInventory has been built up for chipsets for many of the big companies\nfor the forward looking 5 years. Also, the AI models are only getting\nsmaller over time.competitors and other hyperxxxx infrastructure\nproviders is building up.\n\n**Oct 20, 2024**\n\nPast week has been eventful in two ways. One was for me to think about\nwho we really are and second was to appreciate SapceX returning a\nbooster back at the launch pad from the Starship rocket on Sunday. The\nlaunch tower which was dubbed as chopsticks caught the descending\n232-foot stainless steel booster which would be as tall as a 15-storeyed\nbuilding.\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nThe reason it matters is because imagine the acceleration this will\nprovide to significantly reduce the cost of shipping rockets which is a\nmeasure of cost per kilogram of rocketship.\n\n-   When it all started the returning rockets or components came back as\n    > debris so there was no reusability ever\n\n-   Earlier SpaceX launches in the last few years led to successful\n    > recovery however not at the base, that means there was a lot of\n    > cost of moving these heavy objects at the base for repurposing\n\n-   The cost of launching spaceships and satellites have come down from\n    > \\$10,000 to \\$1,000 per kilogram\n\n-   Missions to Mars can only be accomplished if the cost can be brought\n    > down significantly more. Imagine colonization will require sending\n    > so much more in the form of constructing a colony wherever in the\n    > outer space\n\n**Importance of Focus**\n\nMars missions will not be accomplished without the 'focus' and for that\nyou need to know both: what your equivalent Mars colonization mission is\nand how focused are you in accomplishing your mission. Let's go back to\nthe first of the two things I mentioned and think about who we really\nare? We often tend to sway our objectives for our greed as humans for\ncertain designation or a certain remuneration. In the process we lose\nsight of the core objectives so some thoughts on that note:\n\n-   Being artificial and adjusting to suit a culture, organization or a\n    > leader will often set you up for a failure\n\n-   When working for an organization between where you start and to when\n    > you eventually become successful is a long stretched messy middle.\n    > The messy middle can make you impatient and uncomfortable\n\n-   Being comfortable with this discomfort will be a big key for your\n    > success. It takes many years for the organizations/teams to\n    > appreciate what you bring to the table\n\n-   While dealing with the discomfort you will have to build long\n    > lasting relationships and identify sponsors/mentors that will help\n    > you navigate\n\n-   For your mission, how you utilize your time will help you get to\n    > Mars sooner. You will find cross-roads to decide whether you will\n    > do something or delegate a given task. If you are not a leader and\n    > cannot delegate then you will need colleagues to assist you. You\n    > will need to decide which tasks/events will you be a part of or\n    > skip the ones that are not part of your mission. Delegation and\n    > Assistance should only be facilitated with ones who have the\n    > chemistry and relevance to the given tasks/events. We have seen\n    > many figureheads who are just out there so be very careful to not\n    > become one or spend your cycles with figureheads who don't add\n    > value\n\n-   Sometimes we get stuck with the finite nature of outcomes.

It emphasizes innovation, value\n    > creation, and differentiation to make competition irrelevant\n\n**So then let's look at some thought provocations:**\n\nAre you an outlier? Are your objectives or goals when accomplished will\nmake you one? Do you know your goals and are they going to make you an\noutlier?\n\n**Oct 13, 2024**\n\n**Moglis of The AI Jungle**\n\nFollowing my writeup last week, I had the opportunity to spend a lot\nmore time understanding the AI landscape. Some more findings with the\nhope that I will keep it simple for quite a few of my non-tech\nsubscribers to appreciate the depth here.\n\nMost, if not all, of you have used OpenAI/ChatGPT for something or the\nother. OpenAI released quite a few models of its own assuming that each\nincrement captured more knowledge of the world and a greater ability to\nprovide information to its consumers. Assuming that OpenAI would have\npublished half a dozen of their models, HuggingFace which is a\nrepository for models published surpassed a count of Million models in\nthe month of September.\n\nSimilar to language models like OpenAI's language models there are\nmodels to interpret/generate texts, images, voice and other aspects.\nMajority of these are open source and free to use however there is still\na way for them to generate revenues through the use of compute resources\nby consumers and through other partnerships.\n\nAlongside the jungle of models, I saw many coding co-pilots evolve.\n\n**What are Coding Co-pilots?**\n\nIn the Airlines business, between being a pilot and the point where we\nget to complete auto-pilot operations, Co-Pilots are assistants to the\npilots, which we have seen on the airplanes.\n\nLet's assume that a programmer or a coder is a pilot in this case and\nthe AI models/software work as co-pilots to increase the assurance of\ncoder/programmer's (pilot) capabilities. Existing companies like Github\nand Microsoft/OpenAI have their co-pilots namely Github co-pliot and\nCodex from Microsoft. Figma, a design company which helped imagine\nstate-of-the-art User Interfaces, is also building capabilities to\nconvert design templates into ready to use code in a programming\nlanguage of your choice.\n\nA bunch of startups, many with very young co-founders have started\ncompanies like Cursor, Codeium, QoDo (Codium earlier), Poolside, and\nAugment have built similar co-pilots. They are early stage private\ncompanies and have raised anywhere from \\$120M to \\$600M. This market\nhas many players now and will reach a point of saturation between the\nspeed at which they are evolving and the rate at which existing and new\ncompanies are also adding these kinds of capabilities.\n\nSo what do these companies do\n\n-   If you have used (or heard of) VS Code Editor then consider these\n    > are forks of VS Code\n\n-   Coding co-pilots are like really nice autocompletion coding\n    > capabilities on steroids\n\n-   They unify developer communities within an organization\n\n-   Many of these companies actually use their own co-pilots to further\n    > mature their co-pilot capabilities\n\n-   They look over your shoulder as a programmer and are a really great\n    > virtual colleague to have\n\n-   Co-pilot models can validate and help code multiple sections of\n    > multiple files at the same time\n\n-   They can provide AI aided code reviews and unlike manual reviews of\n    > code where we reviewed codes chronologically these editors review\n    > codes logically, keeping in mind the flow of the algorithms\n\n**What are the challenges and opportunities?**\n\nA big challenge exists from the point that input prompts which usually\nare large programming files and the outputs are small sets of\nrecommendations making the models respond with a very low latency (or\nhigh speed). This makes them very responsive however expensive as the\nsize of input tokens into the models need a lot more computation. These\ncompanies that have built co-pilots need to build a lot of caching\nability so that knowledge from previous input prompts can be retained\nand effectively managed.\n\nModels usually respond with an edited version of the code recommending\nchanges that you can remove as codelines from your code (marked in red\nusually) and the codelines which you can add (marked in green usually).\nTo a naked eye of the programmer you can accept or reject these changes\nand upon acceptance the changes are automatically made in the code.\n\nI personally experienced the danger that with all the changes, not being\na regular coder, I tended to accept the changes quickly and changed my\ncode base. Not maintaining a code repository led to a lot of\nknowledge/code loss and I realized that while using these you need to be\nsuper attentive and engrossed in your codebase. It was quite frustrating\nfor me.\n\nThe opportunity lies in the fact that these tools can provide better\ncode review abilities, help maintain version control and also perhaps at\nsome stage show flowchart/graphical/algorithmic representation of the\nrecommended changes.\n\n**In a Nutshell**\n\nThe space is moving rapidly, getting congested, a lot of investor money\nis flowing in and it will be hard to keep up. Naturally, like many other\nphenomena there will be consolidation opportunities through success,\nmergers and gentle fading away of the few companies.\n\nAre you aware of the space? Did I miss anything that you can share? Are\nyou using the co-pilots? Are they making you efficient and smarter or\nmay be efficient and dumber? I am enjoying keeping myself up-to-date.\n\nLet me know if I should write about any other topic of your interest.\n\n**Oct 6, 2024**\n\nBack to AI thoughts after a certain gap. Uber and other equivalent\nplatforms replaced traditional taxi companies, AirBnB displaced the\nhospitality businesses, and cloud technologies displaced traditional\nhardware (Compute, Network & Storage) businesses. We are facing yet\nanother displacement of technology platforms with the advent of AI,\nespecially with the Language Models.\n\nMany hundreds of millions have already accessed LLMs around the planet\nand close to a billion users have directly or indirectly benefited from\nthem.\n\nIt started with GPTs used for inferencing, for writing emails, leading\nto a series of co-pilots, langchain agents to today where the world is\nmoving towards AI agents working under certain orchestration. What does\nthis mean? Where is it going? How will it evolve? Let's examine some\npredictions while asking more questions.\n\n**Generative AI Investments and Expectations**\n\nCompanies continue investing in their Generative AI journeys. Although a\ngreat opportunity lies ahead, the budgets for GenAI are not specialized\nor specific today. From everything that I have seen, GenAI budgets are\ncreated by re-allocation of dollars from Data Analytics, Business\nApplications, spends on Productivity Applications, reduction of\nOutsourced Services, and shift of Robotic Process Automation and\nMarketing budgets to GenAI. GenAI is still seen as generic in the\nbroader technology approach and as a result it lacks specificity in\ndefining roadmaps or objectives. Similarly organizations are still\nunsure about the ROI, both in terms of timing and magnitude of the\nreturns. In a nutshell, the hype of GenAI has gotten a little ahead of\nreality today while I do not dismiss the terrific potential that lies\nahead.\n\n**Evolution of On-Prem and SaaS Applications**\n\nThese began with two distinct divisions. One part covered data models\nthat were either custom designed for a specific solution or a packaged\ndata model that came with the application, on-prem or SaaS based. Second\npart covered the application logic which was built based on certain\nexpected business process behaviors. Millions of application developers\ntoday are employed to manage these comprehensive business systems. The\napplication logic got modularized for performance and efficiencies even\nto the extent of creating microservices based solution architecture.\n\nModern Data Stacks from companies like Snowflake, Databricks and\nhyperscaler's Data Platforms provide access to the data sourced/ingested\nfrom a variety of business systems. Traditional data analytics and\ninsights were drawn using visualization and analytics engines sitting on\ntop of these platforms.\n\n**Language models are changing the traditional game here. Let's examine\nhow?**\n\n**New-Age and largely 'to be' AI/LLM and Data Stack**\n\nContinuing with the narrative of the Datastack, now imagine a data\nharmonization layer that sits above the data stack from providers like\nSnowflake.\n\n1.  At the bottom most layer of this stack, imagine your Data & AI\n    > fabric with LLMs built and integrated into the datasets. LLMs can\n    > be self sourced, open sourced models that are customized or closed\n    > sourced models accessed using the APIs. Heart and soul with cross\n    > company data exists in this datastack layer\n\n2.  Imagine the next layer of specialized Small Language Models which\n    > are derivatives of Large Language Models and provide a continuous\n    > feedback learning loop back into the LLMs. These models interact\n    > with each other, create knowledge graphs and report back causal\n    > (Cause and Effect) outcomes to the underlying LLMs\n\n3.  Lastly, imagine a multi-agent network sitting on top of these\n    > language models along with a master orchestrator\n\nLet me give an example here. Customer interacts with say Customer\nSupport AI agent for a service request. This Customer Support AI agent\nworks with the master orchestrator to interact with Order Management or\nSupply Chain AI agents to provide a specific service to the end\ncustomer. Organization's data is managed with LLMs, SLMs provide\nspecialized function specific learning based on specialized training,\nwhile continuously learning from interactions.\n\n**What will change? When will it change? Will it?**\n\n-   AI Agents will potentially replace SaaS/On-Prem application logic\n    > and microservices such that the logic moves to AI agents\n    > leveraging specialized Small Language Models\n\n-   Learning and improvements of SLMs/LLMs will happen through data and\n    > behaviors, just like a human being would\n\n-   Agents will have complication from the fact that SaaS companies, LLM\n    > providers and Data stack companies are going to introduce their\n    > version of agents\n\n-   Application logic will move from SaaS to the AI agents that are\n    > working with each other\n\n-   LLMs, SLMs, knowledge graphs and causal models will have to play\n    > together such that they replace pre-programmed deterministic SaaS\n    > behaviors with model behaviors\n\n-   Will this displace SaaS companies? Will SaaS companies be\n    > duplicative with both, the application logic and AI agents\n\n-   Will we move from high maintenance white box programmed SaaS logic\n    > to model based self-learning with a potential non-deterministic\n    > mindset\n\n-   Will there be deterrents to slow this growth? Many companies that I\n    > have worked with do not even enable co-pilots owing to security\n    > risks\n\nI personally feel, following my earlier prediction of SaaS, AI and\nBusiness processes to be in a single melting pot, that SaaS is due for\nsome displacement. Although, when and how is for the time to tell. What\ndo you think?\n\n**Sep 29, 2024**\n\nFirstly, my sincere apology for the miss last weekend. I came from\nMumbai late Sunday evening last week and for the 24 hours following 7\ndays up until right now, I went through a long dengue outage. Never been\nthrough a phase like this which I may write about in the near future.\nHere are the thoughts for today in the meantime.\n\nDuring the India-Bangladesh first cricket test match, one of the\ncommentators mentioned how the Indian cricket team must have been on a\nhigh after the world cup win to come and play this series now. I am like\ndid we not lose the world cup, what is he talking about? I had the\npleasure of seeing a few matches of the ODI world cup and a strong\nrecollection of our loss to Australia in the finals.\n\nLet me ask another question here. Do you know who Liz Truss is? Most of\nyou may not - Liz Truss served as the Prime Minister of the United\nKingdom for just 49 days, making her the shortest-serving PM in British\nhistory. Liz Truss\\'s brief tenure was characterized by a failed\neconomic experiment, market instability, and a rapid loss of political\nauthority and support. The speed at which these events unfolded left her\nunable to recover or effectively govern, leading to her short-lived term\nas Prime Minister. This happened in the month of October '22.\n\n**So, what? Why do these events matter?**\n\nVery early in my career I was made aware of one thing. You are as good\nas your worst number or your weakest link. For me India's loss of ODI\nworld cup finals resonated much easier than the relatively recent T20\nworld cup victory. Nobody remembered all the great work Liz Truss would\nhave done to become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She could\nbarely make it to 49 days in her job before her nation became\nunforgiving. They did not let her survive on the account of the grave\nmisses.\n\nEarlier in June I wrote about this Salesforce.com mishap. For having\nreported revenue lower by an absolute number just equating to less than\n0.5% of the forecast revenue, Salesforce.com dropped its valuation by a\nwhopping \\$40B (20%) in just one day.\n\nAssuming the loss in a sporting event is not an error, misses in\nrevenue, project's deadline, political blunders or product security\nlapses can be of grave danger to the brands of both, individuals and\norganizations. A response process needs to be imbibed in the culture of\nthe organization or the fabric of an individual.\n\nOf course now, '\\\"To err is human; to forgive, divine.\\\" Professional\nworld certainly does not experience as much divinity for forgiveness. So\nlet's intervene and ask some questions.\n\n**Do I/We Err and if so What do I/We do?**\n\nIn the information age, news and words travel at rocket speed. So when\nyou err, here is what one must do:\n\nWhen errors happen, good leaders treat errors as opportunities for\nlearning and organizational improvement, sharing lessons with their\nteams to foster a culture of growth. They\n\n-   Communicate transparently and promptly\n\n-   Assess the impact and prioritize mitigation\n\n-   Implement a robust fix and learn from the incident\n\n-   Hold people accountable while fostering a no-blame culture.\n\n-   Rebuild trust through consistent actions\n\n-   Show empathy and offer support\n\n**Asking yourself:**\n\nDo you recall a time when you made a blunder? Did you find someone else\nto point a finger at or could take charge of what transpired? Do you\nrecall such a situation that happened around you and how a given leader\nplayed her part?\n\nIs your organization or you as an individual prepared for unforeseen\ntimes? Do you have a plan or even a mindset to respond with calm?\n\nSep 15, 2024\n\nHave you ever thought of how inflation is measured? Of course, in a way\nit is a measure of affordability of goods and services. I was curious so\nI asked who measures, what it measures and how?\n\nInflation is measured using Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer\nPrice Index (PPI) as a measure to know the rise or fall in the price of\ngoods and services over time. This measure will play a key role in soon\nto be announced interest rate adjustments in the United States by the\nFederal Reserve Bank.\n\nIt is a measure of affordability for housing, food, transportation,\nhealthcare and education. Federal Agents (Humans) measure the costs of\nthese items in 75 urban areas for what the consumers actually pay after\nadjusting for discounts and promotions. The percentage change from the\nbase price is determined as increase/decrease in the current price\ndetermining if the movement is inflationary (costs increase) or\ndeflationary (costs decrease). Similarly, PPI is tracked by interacting\nwith producers for what are the trends in the selling price of housing,\ntransportation, food, healthcare and education.\n\nTwo questions then come to mind. In the age of AI and LLMs why do we\nneed humans to measure this and what other indexes do exist and how they\nare measured. Here are the few notable ones.\n\nVolatility Index: This is a forward-looking index that reflects market\nparticipants\\' expectations of volatility over the next 30 days. The\nmore investors expect significant price swings in the near future, the\nhigher the volatility index will be. In simple terms, it's a barometer\nof the market\\'s anxiety level. It measures the 'fear factor' from the\nreal financial data and is far more automated than the CPI/Inflation\nmeasure with human involvement.\n\nGlobal Temperature and Climate Indices track the planet's health. They\nare far more accurate and tracked over a long period, even in the\ncentury years.\n\nArctic Sea Ice Extent Index tracks the changes in the size of the Arctic\nice cap, which is a crucial indicator of global warming.\n\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) which is observed on a daily basis even by\ncommon (wo)man is critical for understanding the health impacts of air\npollution in cities worldwide. The AQI is calculated based on\nmeasurements of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10),\nozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon\nmonoxide (CO).\n\nOf course, we are all aware of indexes like NASDAQ, DJIA (in the US) and\nSENSEX (BSE in India) as a measure of stock market's performance.\n\nWhile most of these indices are \\*\\*highly accurate\\*\\*, they can still\nface challenges related to data collection in less-developed or remote\nareas, timeliness, and the complexity of the phenomena they measure\n(e.g., biodiversity or water stress).\n\nSo, What is in it for me? Now imagine a 'Personal Index' that would\nmeasure you by you. What if you were to measure yourself? What would the\nperformance basis be - would it be others around you or just you in\ncomparison how much better you are this year compared to what you were\nlast year?\n\nI imagine life similar to a game of golf - how better is your current\ngame to the past game as I just compete with myself to be a better me. I\nwould rather be a racehorse with blinders on the sides to not be\ndistracted by the world around me.\n\nDo you know of other critical indexes that I may have missed? Do you\nthink of other imaginary indexes that can exist? Are you a racehorse or\na fiercely competitive individual that always looks around?"

Today's thoughts are a\ntrigger of this basic understanding.\n\n**Tug of War between Approach and Outcomes**\n\nImagine a project where you have invested a fair, if not significant,\namount of time and resources. It could be about learning a comprehensive\nskill like becoming a financial advisor, working for a cause like a\nnot-for-profit initiative to provide education for underprivileged\nsociety or building your own business or a company.\n\nWith most of these, you would have explicit or implicit end goals in\nmind: It can be about outcomes like revenue, profits, sales, a new job,\npromotion, number of lives enriched or number of trees planted. It can\nbe anything. For the sake of simplicity, let's call these **outputs**.\n\nTo achieve your goals, you need resources in any combination of funds,\nskills, processes, people and institutions. You leverage these resources\nand navigate through circumstances that involve bureaucracy, chemistry\nand other real-life challenges. For the sake of simplicity, let's call\nthese as **inputs**.\n\nTime goes by and you reach a point where you have made progress with\nyour stated goals or **outputs**. Through the process, you may realize\nsome surprising findings about your environment: your **inputs** in\nterms of your beliefs or values are conflicted. You are on the course to\nachieve your goals (outputs) and there are fundamental questions that\nremain unanswered about the methodology employed. Possibly to be even\nmore clearer that the methodology employed is not aligned with how you\nthink.\n\nWith **inputs**, methodology or the process employed, there are three\npossibilities:\n\n1.  In an ideal world, with a fairy tale perspective, methodologies are\n    > perfect (inputs) and they are in turn yielding desirable outcomes\n    > (outputs)\n\n2.

Often you get the stated results however the methodology employed is\n    > somewhat or significantly compromised\n\nIn scenarios 2 & 3 above you have some decisions to make. Obviously, in\nscenario #2 above, you need to realize quickly and decide if you need to\nfail fast. In a situation like #3 above, you need a deeper examination.\nWhat does that look like?\n\n**Fail Fast or Deliberate**\n\nThis is a game of your conscience: Milk the cow (proverbially) or Fix\nthe game\n\n-   If your fundamental beliefs are compromised then it is a lot easier\n    > to fail than to deliberate\n\n-   If there is an opportunity to navigate and fix the methodology and\n    > the associated process assuming you want to capitalize on the\n    > progress and fix the methodology then certainly stay the course\n\n    a.

    "content": "As we end the year, let\\'s think about Agents (AI) and Agency (Human).\nMost of the AI based approaches are to mimic and exemplify human\nbehaviors in machines. Conversely, for this time, let's personify this\n'Agentic Mindset' inside a Human Being.\n\n**A Recap: AI Agents**\n\nEarlier in October (Oct 6), I wrote about AI agents.\n\nSpecialized AI agents are typically Small Language Models which are\nderivatives of Large Language Models and provide a continuous feedback\nlearning loop back into the LLMs. These models interact with each other,\ncreate knowledge graphs and report back causal (Cause and Effect)\noutcomes to the underlying LLMs. Specialized agents offer artificial\nintelligence in a specific scenario.\n\nIn simple words, compared to a Large Language Model like ChatGPT\nresponding to any kind of questions a specialized model is trained for a\nspecific purpose like writing SQL statements or in simpler terms a\nfitness tracking app using TinyGPT will suggest workout routines based\non user history and goals.\n\nJust remember that in the Agentic AI architecture, orchestrating layer\ncan invoke calls to multiple specialized agents.\n\n**High Agency Mindset Orchestration**\n\nHigh agency mind (of a human) is trained to take full control of her\nactions and destiny and not wait for perfect conditions or blame the\nexternal environment. If you were a 'high agency' individual, your\norchestration layer would be a very determined mindset that will always\navoid hallucination. You will invoke a variety of agents in your\npersonal space to persuade, to navigate, to not be distracted and to\nconstantly be a mechanic of reinforced learning through any kind (human\nor machine) feedback. Your mind here is strengthened to activate variety\nof personal agents\n\n-   One set of agents will keep your focus on pursuing goals with\n    > determination. This agent conceives ideas and turns them into\n    > concrete actions\n\n-   An agent in you will take responsibility of your life and focus on\n    > what you can control\n\n-   An agent that will evaluate situations based on your knowledge\n    > repository and wisdom more than accepting external opinions\n\n-   Another agent to push through challenges: this one will especially\n    > look for how other individuals that do not have high agency are\n    > not distracting you. Distractions can come from external agencies,\n    > largely humans, who can be a combination of nay sayers or are\n    > conservative thinkers in nature\n\nAs a high-agility individual, you are always on your 'treadmill',\nenergizing others, seeking growth, and not giving up on constraints.\n\nThis is a great time of the year to reflect on your grit. Ask yourself:\nAm I trained to stay focused? Do I realize when distractions slow me\ndown? Do I find an excuse or blame in the outside world? Are my goals\nbig enough?"

Two thoughts on that\nnote: A corollary between new-age AI-enabled smart devices and\ncommunicating effectively.\n\n**For Your 'Ears' Only:** If there was a James Bond movie starring\ncurrently available smart devices then it would certainly be titled as\n'For Your Ears Only', just for the fact that they always have their ears\nON. You have already experienced how you are talking about something\nwith your friends or family and the next thing you see is a promotional\nadvertisement of products related to your conversations on your social\nand professional media feeds.\n\nAs soon as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Super\nIntelligence (ASI) will kick in, you will see an AGI/ASI starrer\nrepresentation of Matrix (Keanu Reeves Sci-Fi from 1999).\n\nThis eavesdropping of AI in our lives made me think about what it means\nto keep our ears open as a human or do we behave like Mahatma Gandhi's\nthree monkeys: See No Evil, Hear No Evil and Speak No Evil.\nUnfortunately, modern-day organizations are not wired to sustain this\nthought.\n\nLet's devise how one can behave in an organizational setup.\n\n**Redefining 'See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil':** To do the\nbest in your profession you need to keep your ears open.

After all, modern-day\norganizations (for profit or otherwise) are designed to drive certain\noutcomes and we often hear the other corporate jargon: If you see\nsomething then say something. Here is a quick look at what modern-day\norganizational monkeys would look like (courtesy DALL.lE openAI) and\nthis was the prompt: 'Can you create a visual representation that shows\nGandhi's 3 monkeys with a slight modification that shows one monkey with\nhear no evil selectively listening with one ear open, second one with\nappreciating the evil with one eye open and the third one speaking\nwisely... perhaps sitting in a corporate setup inside a conference room'\n\n![](media/image15.png){width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.7083333333333335in\"}\n\n**How does one execute being an effective communicator?**\n\n-   'Seeing/Hearing' things require effective reading of the room.\n    > Knowing who is in charge (the authority), knowing participants,\n    > body language, responses from yes (wo)men, the silence of the\n    > quiet ones, the hollow loudspeakers and authentic participants is\n    > important.

Did it help or backfire? Will you try and become so, if\nyou did not voice out your part in the past? Do you think differently?\n\nHappy New Year"

Today, there is no unmanned surveillance or preventive defense\nmechanism in place to detect and prevent these outrages. There are some\ncompanies that provide aerial intelligence to help with the defense\nmechanism for the responding agencies however that is not enough.\nSignificant progress in AI and Quantum Computing is required to defend\nthe planet from these calamities.\n\nAs the progressive changes evolve in the AI space, it will expose us to,\nboth, the curses and the boons. [[Geoffery\nHinton]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/27/godfather-of-ai-raises-odds-of-the-technology-wiping-out-humanity-over-next-30-years),\nthe Godfather of AI, quotes that there is a 10% to 20% chance of AI\nleading to human extinction in three decades. Well the outlook is fairly\npositive with that low probability, however there is a possibility of\nextinction as well from the low probability. To the best of my\nunderstanding, the impact will not be probabilistic, but of some\nproportionate representation of change in our lives. In a way Hinton\nactually increased the chances from 10 to 10-20% range and in response\nhe stated that we have never had to deal with things (AI) more\nintelligent than ourselves before. The only thing that came close was an\nexample of an infant baby that controlled her mother, who is the more\nintelligent of the two.\n\n**What it takes to prevent Rome from burning:** What does it then take\nto positively engage with this fast changing world and what do you focus\non? Two weeks back I brought up this 'high agency' mindset and here are\nsome thoughts that purely focus on the input process and value focus on\nthe quality of work done as opposed to the quantitative outcomes.\n\n**The Process Outlook**\n\n-   While not demeaning '(y)our' formal education, you will not learn\n    > anything deeply in your basic undergrad programs.

Don't use one off answers from these tools but build\n    > skills to master a given topic with a lot of foundational details\n    > and then apply the tools of learning. It does not mean that you\n    > walk into your physician's clinic, and post doing some cursory\n    > research on the internet, tell her what is wrong with you.\n\n**Being Obsessed:** In addition to having a great process outlook you\nneed to obsessed with:\n\n1.  Simplicity for what you build\n\n2.  Apply Design Thinking\n\n3.  Speaking like how your Customer would like to hear from you\n\n4.  Communicating to the world with a Marketing mindset\n\n5.  Giving them an experience, not a product\n\nAfter all Larry Ellison (Oracle), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Steve Jobs\n(Apple), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) and Elon Musk (X, SpaceX, Tesla,\nNeuralink) obsessively built the greatest of the companies focusing on\nprocess outlook. They all also have the commonality of dropping out of\ntheir college programs at some point.\n\nSo coming back to the latest controversy on absolute 90 hours a week\neffort, do you believe if all of these leaders worked hard? They all did\nand they still do - the good thing is nobody told them to. My take away\nfor that is to remain net neutral of what these 90 hours a week opinions\nand pushes are - make your choices, build your process, be obsessed and\ndo what is right for you.\n\n**"

We completed more than 2 years of significant advances\nin AI/LLMs, post OpenAI's ChatGPT announcement in Nov '22.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, tractors were introduced with the\nmindset of efficiently feeding the humankind and not to create\ndisharmony in the agricultural economy. AI has to operate similarly;\nelse, with all our jobs eliminated, we will have machines working with\nthe machines and make humans extinct in the process. It is very unlikely\nthat humans will destroy her race. This necessitates the AI and the\nmachines to coexist in harmony with humans.\n\n**What has changed in the last 2 years?**\n\nObviously, the first thing we got access to was a very simple ability to\nprompt the models with our questions. Advances in the AI/LLMs\nimprovised, both, the professionals and the people consuming their\nservices. Here are some examples:\n\n-   Content Creators and Copywriters: Nowadays, a lot of the blogs and\n    > content are seamlessly created with the use of LLMs. Grammarly.com\n    > and Writer.com provide powerful AI based writing and editing tools\n\n-   Administrative Tools: AI tools now help to automate email\n    > correspondence, meeting scheduling, travel management and data\n    > trend identification.

If you are a professional in a non-AI field, your knowhow\nand use of these evolving frameworks will keep you relevant, make you\nhyper productive and make you a successful leader in your journeys.\n\nAdditionally, AI will also expose us to new age vulnerabilities and will\nnecessitate more growth in building specialized skills, information\nsecurity, and intelligent data management.\n\n**Convergence of AI, Robotics and the Physical World**\n\nWe will see this convergence in healthcare to conduct remote and robotic\nsurgeries, as humanoids in factory setup, autonomous full service\ndriving, ai-powered robots for companionship, monitoring for the\nelderly, in warfare and in securing the physical world from calamities.\n\n**As I wrap this topic,** let's not forget that AI based executive\nassistant will support human business leaders, AI based content will be\nread by humans, AI in Healthcare will enable physicians and benefit the\nhumans after all, full service driving or autonomous vehicles will move\nhumans or goods consumed by humans, humanoids will help produce goods\nfor the use of humans and care for elder humans (not just machines) and\nAI will support customers who are humans....

    "content": "**\n\n**It\\'s time for an AI update, once again.** Most of you are familiar\nwith ChatGPT (OpenAI's Large Language Model) which enables tasks for\ntext generation, translation and natural language processing based on\nthe large source of text datasets, which are widely available on the\nInternet or otherwise. ChatGPT and other models evolved to become\nmulti-modal in nature to process modalities of texts, voice, images and\nvideos to generate output in form of texts, voices and images, largely\nspeaking.\n\n**Outlook for the year 2025:** I have already mentioned about AI agents\nand here is the recap to level set baseline understanding for today's\nwrite-up:\n\nSpecialized AI agents are typically Small Language Models, as\nderivatives of Large Language Models. They provide a continuous feedback\nlearning loop back into the LLMs. These models interact with each other,\ncreate knowledge graphs and report back causal (Cause and Effect)\noutcomes to the underlying LLMs. Specialized agents offer artificial\nintelligence in a specific scenario.\n\nIn simple words, compared to a Large Language Model like ChatGPT\nresponding to any kind of questions a specialized model is trained for a\nspecific purpose like writing SQL statements or in simpler terms a\nfitness tracking app can be created from using TinyGPT, which can\nsuggest workout routines based on user history and goals.\n\nOpenAI announced the 'O' series (the letter O and not the number 0) of\nmodels starting with O1 and recently released model chatGPT O3. Both\nthese models respond with well-reasoned explanations. To understand with\nan example, for a prompt like \"If Sarah is older than Tom, and Tom is\nolder than Mike, who is the youngest?\" ChatGPT O1 will respond after\nreasoning to understand that Sarah is older than Tom, Tom is older than\nMike and therefore, the age hierarchy is: Sarah \\> Tom \\> Mike to\nconclude that Mike is the youngest. Comparatively, version O3 provides\ndeeper and complex reasoning making it more capable, however it becomes\nslower due to increased 'think time'.\n\nIn addition, OpenAI announced the operator mode which is available for\nthe advanced users who pay \\$200 a month for their subscription.\nOperator mode works like a classic human operator to solve complex\nproblems with AI: for example if you provide a recipe, image of\navailable ingredients in your refrigerator or pantry then the operator\nmode can identify the missing ingredients. It will go and prep your\norder for the online grocery provider and wait for you to submit the\norder.\n\nThe reasoning, operator mode and the agentic AI capabilities will be\ngreatly leveraged in 2025.\n\n**Chinese Goods have arrived: DeepSeek** is a Chinese AI startup that\nhas developed advanced language models, notably the DeepSeek-R1, the\nopensource AI model that is as powerful as OpenAI's O1. Notably, it was\nreleased within only 2 months of OpenAI's O3 release. They also released\n6 additional small scale models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters.\nRemember that a parameter is a weight assigned as a connection between 2\nneurons of a model, which adjusts during the training of the model and\nimproves predictions. Smaller models provide ease of use, low cost and\nbetter efficiency for well defined problems.\n\n-   Like many classic Chinese goods, cost of million input tokens is\n    > only \\$0.55 and million output tokens is \\$2.19. OpenAI is 7x more\n    > expensive in comparison\n\n-   While reasoning DeepSeek-R1 shares the underlying chain of thoughts\n    > similar to explanation provided above to determine Mike as the\n    > youngest of the 3 people\n\n-   DeepSeek-R1 Model was built cost-effectively as, unlike OpenAI, not\n    > much consideration was put on safety and was built with very high\n    > IQ Chinese engineers, of course at a much lower cost. Sounds apt\n    > for Chinese product\n\n-   Although this low cost model will allow many startups to compete\n    > easily in the grander scale\n\n**Announcing Stargate, a \\$500B US led AI Initiative:** On another note,\nlast week, Donald Trump led the announcement of \\$500 billion AI\ninfrastructure project in the United States as Joint venture between\nOpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX, an Emirati investment firm.\n\n-   \\$500B will be spent between now and 2029 with \\$100B already\n    > committed for deployment in 2025 with the first data center\n    > deployment in Abilene, Texas\n\n-   This AI infrastructure aims to enable early cancer detection using\n    > AI-powered blood tests, develop personalized cancer vaccines using\n    > AI and mRNA\n\n-   It will also support various AI applications across industries\n    > including healthcare and national security\n\n-   With this large investment plan, it will create significant entry\n    > barriers for desiring bad actors\n\n-   Of course, China and other leading economies will bounce back with\n    > their investments and probably even a low cost alternative\n\nThis \\$500B investment is in addition to\n\n-   Colossus, Musk's 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs supercomputer built\n    > already to expand to 200,000 GPUs and eventual scale of over 1\n    > million GPUs.

Some of you are leaders or matured practitioners in your\nprofession, some are aspiring to be the leader tomorrow and some in\nearly phase of their careers. Let's assume different roles to dig\ndeeper.\n\n**Circle of Life:** As a parent or as a child, you have experienced\nsituations where perceivingly one sibling gets a lot of attention and\nmany of her shortcomings were tolerated. You may have been a sibling who\nwas benefitted or in a given situation you were impacted by privileges\nthe other ones received. As a parent, you may have unintentionally\nfavored one child over the other. Similarly, in a professional setup you\nhave seen colleagues who have been favorites in an organization and as a\nleader you may have favored one bunch over the others, yet again\nunintentionally. Friends also share similar behaviours or feelings with\neach other.\n\nIn all these interactions you are impacted from other people's\nbehaviors: some demonstrate anger, some share complaints, some become\nseemingly or relatively dysfunctional or nonperformant in their jobs.\n\n**The Lion King:** Whether family, friends or professional setup, you\nhave relationships with other people and their relative (in)abilities to\nbe expressive. In my professional leadership development workshops, I\nspend a lot of time on cognizance (awareness of world around us):\nability to understand the workplace, the environment, the economy, the\nculture and most importantly the people at all levels.\n\nA key aspect of cognizance requires extraordinary communication skills.\n\n-   When someone is complaining, whining or showing unruly behavhiors,\n    > many a times, they don't say what they really want to say\n\n-   These behaviors can distort you and frustrate you as you don't have\n    > time for all this.

Why am I holding myself responsible for these people? They are\nadult co-workers, friends or family so get your game together guys.\nUnfortunately, life does not work like this. As a result be **the king,\nthe Lion King**:\n\n-   Firstly, enjoy being in the position of power that someone is\n    > trusting you to be the confidante\n\n-   Lend them your ears. Try and understand what they actually want to\n    > say\n\n-   Don't judge people in a very hard way as it it detrimental to both\n    > the parties\n\n-   On January 5th, I wrote about reading the room and similarly today\n    > the message is to focus on the other person and try to understand\n    > why they came to you\n\nWhen someone asks for your time irrespective of what the issue is give\nit to them right away. Don't setup a meeting to decide when the actual\nmeeting will happen. I have seen many conversations, that actually only\nneed 5-10 of hallway or drive-time conversations, take weeks to be\nsetup. So move at the pace of the progress AI is making and be out\nthere. Always check-in on people you care about.\n\nThis is why: unusual part of thoughts this week as I need all of you to\nspend 2 minutes to watch this video.\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX8TgVR33KM>\n\n**"

Of\n    > course, I need someone to tell me what this should be - it is a\n    > natural tendency\n\nEither I need someone to tell me what the larger purpose of the\ninstitution or the organization should be or if I am an independent one\nperson entity then I will keep pushing to do what I do in the best\npossible manner without defining this BHAG (Be-HAG).\n\nWhat do you do if this does not exist in your definition of life? I say\none of 3:\n\n-   Ask for the larger purpose which the institution or the organization\n    > is driving towards\n\n-   If you cannot get this purpose clearly from them then recommend for\n    > what it should be and use it as a reference to create your purpose\n    > for navigation\n\n-   If you are an independent one person entity then create your Be-HAG,\n    > something that you think is largely unachievable\n\nNow tie your life relentlessly to achieve this. It does not mean you\ndon't take the time to drink your poison, smell the roses or have a good\ntime. Intersperse life and the purpose of it.\n\nAs a human being, you can also be slightly multi-purposed. I know of\nthis ambitious person who wants to ensure that no one sleeps hungry, at\nleast in her vicinity. She can certainly do so however unless you are\nsitting on a gold mine, you are not going to easily be able to feed the\nworld. In this instance, she can have a professional goal to excel in\nher work and generate a lot of wealth. She can incrementally then work\ntowards the larger goal of feeding the world. She can certainly have 2\nBHAGs. This is your life and you have choices to make.\n\nWith that said, ask yourself if you know of your BHAG, your\norganization's BHAG, are you going to ask for it in absence of one and\ncreate one if you do not gain that clarity. I want to follow up on this\nthought to write about how we can remain undeterred with our BHAGs and\nstay focused. Next week on that aspect.\n\nAs a starter, I heard this somewhere. Define your BHAG and start working\non this, the path will appear. Clarity does not come before action, it\ncomes from action.\n\n**February 23, 2025 - 96**\n\nMy first introduction to a computing processor (CPU) was to an Intel\nchip number 8086. A simple program to add two numbers '3' and '5' looked\nlike this.\n\n-   3E 05; C6 03; 76\n\n-   This was machine language code to say, load number 05 in a register\n    > (3E)\n\n-   Add immediately the number 03 to the register (C6)\n\n-   Halt the program (76)\n\nAssembly language was the next improvement to the above machine language\nrepresentation, which was primarily a program in terms of hexadecimal\nnumbers (16 digits in the form of 0 to 9 followed by A to F compared to\ndecimals ranging only from 0 to 9). The same program was written in\nAssembly language with a slight improvement for human understanding:\n\n-   MVI 03, A (Move 3 to A)\n\n-   ADI 05 (Add 05 to A so A = A + 05)\n\n-   HLT (Halt the program)\n\nProgramming languages like FORTRAN, C, C++, and Java brought in many\nadvances. We use the algorithmic representation in understanding the\nproblem and solution which is a lot more English-like along with\nincreased sophistication and functionality. We write modules that were\ninvoked as reusable components of programs. We write algorithms and\nassociated code which become reusable as well.\n\n**So, why talk about this somewhat antiquated representation of life?**\n\nWith continuous progression and scientific growth, we can solve many\nproblems without needing to know what lies beneath the engine. I have\nbeen writing 'Sunday Thoughts' for a while now and wished to create a\nportal. Sandeep Upadhyay, my colleague and our PMO head in India,\noffered to help during his weekend to get this out, however it continued\nto stay in the backburner of my priorities up until now.\n\n-   Most of the people I associate with now have the ability to use AI\n    > and the large language models to ask questions, compose emails and\n    > brainstorm thoughts. Remember that 40% of the world still does not\n    > have access to the Internet or the SmartPhones\n\n-   The next thing after LLMs that we have is a workbench to write code\n    > using some of the available code accelerators or co-pilots.

In my example, I told the\n    > operator to pick each of my writeup files and give it a title.\n\n-   It **decides which external tool** to call (e.g., DALL·E for images,\n    > Python for code execution).

It organized my postgres database with all the intricate\n    > details for each of the articles, individual pdf files and the ai\n    > generated images that represent the article.\n\nThis seamless integration allows you to generate multimedia, code, and\ndynamic information in one interactive conversation. So essentially my\nprocess last week became a write-up for the thoughts this week.\n[[Here]{.underline}](https://st-rust-rho.vercel.app/) is the\nrepresentation of the first cut and also access to the past write-ups.\n\nHope you all can leverage on this automated operator assistant similarly\nor better.\n\n**February 16, 2025**\n\n**In 2 Decades:** Prior to plotting this chart, I could not have\nrecognized half of these plotted logos. If you put your birth year in\nperspective you can think of how much of your life has overlapped ever\nsince 2004 that the ~~not so~~ smart devices gave you the pleasure of\nsolo-time in the fantasy islands created by these platforms. We have\nmoved away from 'sharing the feelings' to 'seeing/showing fantasies'.\n\n![](media/image8.png){width=\"2.7777777777777776e-2in\"\nheight=\"2.7777777777777776e-2in\"}![](media/image3.png){width=\"6.5in\"\nheight=\"3.7222222222222223in\"}\n\nBeyond the social fantasies is the world of assumptive entitlements.\nPerks in the social or professional environments are often taken for\ngranted. Fitness centers in the housing or commercial complexes remain\ngreatly underutilized as you have paid for them indirectly. Free coffee\nat the office (some of the luckier ones get a lot more) is taken for\ngranted. So, why all this?\n\n**The 'Giver' Mindset:** One big thing besides the perks that remains\nunderutilized is in the contagion you can offer. Earlier, I had\nmentioned about the fact that the first thing people notice when they\nsee you, are your hands, not your outfits or your shoes.\n\nThis greatly underutilized contagion of being and feeling good, which is\neasily available to you remains largely unnoticed. Here is a quick\nchecklist to be able to share and communicate with others:\n\n-   Assuming that others around you, especially the quiet ones, are okay\n    > is dangerous\n\n-   Your team, at home and at the workplace, need assurances more often\n    > than you can imagine\n\n-   Communicating often and giving occasional praises go a long way,\n    > especially in intense workplaces\n\n-   Communicating failures, bumps or challenges in timely manner matters\n    > a lot\n\n-   Timely expressiveness of joy and connection creates a safety net for\n    > others\n\n-   These investments build credibility for to you to later share tough\n    > messages easily\n\n-   If you are one of those who can't express with words then you can\n    > bring in cookies to share\n\nOne more thing that I learnt lately is that we make a lot of reforms\nwith fitness, learning or wake up schedule. Most of us suck at keeping\nup to them. Above all of these reforms, sits the determination to do\nwhat you decide to do. If there is one thing that you can fix then this\nis it: the sheer determination to keep up to your own commitments to\nself. So what you are waiting for, go ahead and bake those cookies for\nyour buds.\n\n**"

When we do speak with self, we drift away from the\ncurrent moment of time and create chatter. Think about, as mentioned\nlast week, having a defined BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) and then\nconstantly drifting our mind away from objective(s).\n\nSome examples of how it happens. You are driving and all of a sudden you\narrived at your destination without even remembering how you got there,\nnot remembering your list of groceries at the grocery store you had\ndecided to purchase when you left home or not remembering what you read\nthrough the chapter of a book by the time you reach at the end of the\nchapter. Chatter is normal and not all chatter is bad.\n\nWhen in a social context, we use the reflection from chatter to impress\nothers from our conversations, which is quite natural. At the same time,\nwe can use this inner voice as an advantage to achieve our goals. We\nalso need to recognize that while we were formally taught to learn\nmaths, learn to paint, or even learn to swim, no one taught us to\nconcentrate as a skill. Teachers always told us to pay attention however\nnever to show 'how'?\n\n**Technology Traps:** An easy example of how we easily get distracted is\nin the infinite loop of social media reels. They work our mind in\norchestration with our implied expectations of distraction. You don't\neven know what the next reel would be, however 'they' have figured out\nwhat will make you stick. Our ability to pay attention or stay focused\non the task at hand is very low so we go in this endless loop. In\nanother example, imagine you are sitting on your couch and you get\ncalled to help by your spouse or your parent. Your ability to respond to\nthem is much lower than a passive beep from your phone's messages.\nTechnology can be good as long as we are incharge of it.\n\nEverything written on this page so far is about 'knowing' what causes\ndistractions. Now a little bit on 'Focusing' or 'Being'.\n\n**Focusing or Being (2):** Being 'meditative objectively' is an\noxymoronic thought. To meditate with a purpose will not happen. Although\nmarried to one, I am nowhere close to being a practitioner, let alone\nwriting about it.\n\nImagine you are watching a movie, the director has written the script to\nnavigate in your mind to make you feel angry, joyful, hungry, sad or\neven lusty, all within a span of a short window. In one of the learning\nvideos, I saw that in order to increase focus and not experience all\nthese emotions in our chatter, we need to focus. Focus momentarily\nclosing your eyes on the chair you might be sitting on, close your eyes\nto bring awareness to the room you are sitting in, remember the event\nlike a wedding or a birthday party you may have attended recently or\nyour recent holidays. One of the things we started following recently in\nmy family is to remember in the morning all the things we ate or drank\nin the previous 24 hours, everything. This is hard and you will tend to\nforget many things you ate including a small candy. If practiced well,\nit will allow you to identify moments to focus, bring awareness of what\nyou ate and take you back to your guilty pleasures from the day before.\n\n**Expecting Rightly (3)**: I personally realize that knowing and then\nignoring distractions is easier, being objectively meditative is a lot\nharder and as a result it will be much easier for me to manage\nexpectations. Here are some for me:\n\n-   Be cognitively aware of distractions, dissolve chatter and focus as\n    > much as possible\n\n-   Avoid getting supplements or being drugged in order to induce sleep\n    > or bringing peace to mind\n\n-   Sleep, Exercise and eat healthy (hard, hard, hard)\n\n-   Distance yourself from remunerations or sitting in the expectations\n    > of glory\n\n-   Build long term goals and not expect short term returns\n\nSo ask yourself a question in this very materialistic and dystopian\nworld, where you do want to always to be:\n\n-   Knowing your distractions in real-time (1),\n\n-   Being meditative (2) or\n\n-   Setting manageable expectations (3)\n\nTruth is always somewhere in between."

    "content": "#99\n\nA write-up of a modern day Fantasy Land.\n\n**Then and Now**\n\nWhen I first saw a Tesla car at a showroom in San Jose around 2011, I\ncould see that there was no engine in the car and the front of the\nvehicle had empty space which was referred to as 'Frunk - as a Frontside\nTrunk'. It was my 'what the frunk?' moment. Electric Vehicles actually\nwere invented a bit prior to the combustion engine vehicles however\nrechargeable batteries were not invented then. After a very long history\nof more than 125 years of commercial use of combustion engine vehicles,\nhybrid technology was employed in Battery/Gasoline versions of cars like\nNissan Leaf, Toyota Prius and Chevy Volt. It was followed by a massive\nrevolution in Electric Vehicles through large scale production of EVs by\nTesla. [Many followed this trait.]{.mark} Today, we are at the cusp of\nFSD (Full Self Driving) in its nascent phase.\n\nAnother pot where life is melting similar to automobiles, is software\nengineering. Coding co-pilots are enhancing (or disrupting) the lives of\nsoftware engineers. Your mastery from expertise and experience of\nprogramming languages is getting replaced by co-pilots, which accelerate\nyour throughputs by giving 3x productivity on average. You summon the\nco-pilot with the best of the commands (pun intended) and it responds\nexceedingly well.\n\nWith another perspective, Modern telescopes like the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) can observe light emitted billions of years ago due to\na combination of advanced engineering, infrared technology, and the\nfundamental nature of light itself. This part has fascinated me for\nyears. We can see the past because of the 'time machine' effect captured\nby these telescopes from the light that takes billions of years to reach\nearth. Increase in the mirror size (2.4m to 6.5m) and increase in the\nwavelength capture range (0.1 to 2.5 microns to 0.6 to 28.5 microns) has\nmade JSWT far more capable then the preceding Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n**Now and Then**\n\nHuman Gut Microbiome or the Gut Microbiota is composed of microorganisms\nincluding bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Functions of diet, lifestyle and\nage can have an adverse or positive effect on the health of the gut to\nenable immunity, vitamin creation, immune system modulation and\nmaintaining the barrier to keep the gut health intact. Damaged gut can\nimpact heart health, liver health, and mental health resulting in\ndiseases/dysfunctionality like cholesterol, diabetes, fatty liver,\ndeteriorated circadian rhythm and more. Supplements like Super gut and\nprocedures like Fecal Microbial Transplant (replacing your Gut\nMicrobiome entirely from a healthy gut) can attack and fix the\nunderlying gut surface area which actually is a cause for many of the\nnamed diseases.\n\nIn another example, introduction of 'Neuralink' in experimental stages\nwill help to manage significant dysfunctions in the human back problems\nand even the vision. This is giving a huge hope in fixing a lot of\nphysical impairments by leveraging healthcare and technology\nimprovements together.\n\n**So why this and that with 'Now/Then and Then/Now'?**\n\nA lot will change in the field of automobiles, software, healthcare,\ntransportation and more.\n\n-   You will see flying cars as potential improvement to Full Service\n    > Driving (FSD)\n\n-   By combining capabilities of images, audio visuals, write-ups, and\n    > 'sora' (OpenAI's video creation tool) like tools, your great\n    > grandchildren will be able to see your past life similar to James\n    > Webb Space Telescope seeing the space (this is scary - they are\n    > going to find out either way so this is the best point in time to\n    > start behaving)\n\n-   Human body parts and diseases will be easily replaced and cured\n    > respectively with a lot more ease\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n-   As an auto mechanic in less than 2 decades from now if/when all the\n    > combustion engine vehicles have been retired, you will need a new\n    > set of skills.

It took a few years of this\nperseverance and she eventually published her book about being a working\nmom. My lead to dedicatedly use part of my weekend to study about the\ntopics of my interest was an instigation from her approach. I knew that\nto make this drastic change for my own expectations needed both, the\ndiscipline and a measurable outcome.\n\nI kept the process as simple as possible. Every weekend I look for\nsignificant changes in the world around us: Technology, Geopolitics,\nEconomics and their interdependence on each other.\n\n-   **Technology** has been an instrumental foundation for the economic\n    > growth at least in the last decade\n\n-   Keeping aside some religious fanatics, **Geopolitical** tugs of war\n    > have been around 'energy' and 'natural' resources\n\n-   Transportation, Manufacturing, Technology, Warfare and more:\n    > **Economic** prosperity of nations from these mentioned activities\n    > is significantly dependent on 'energy' and 'resources', in\n    > addition to their unwavering focus on education and political\n    > stability. Hence the interdependence of the three on each other\n\nOur navigation to exist in this interdependent world requires very high\nacumen and cognizance and hence a lot of my write-ups also focus on\n**'Thought Leadership'.** This defines the quad of my categories of\nwriting: AI/Technology, Geopolitics, Macroeconomics and Thought\nLeadership.\n\n**Perseverance**: The need for measuring what I learnt, selfishly\nspeaking, created the 'Sunday Thoughts' series. In the two year that I\nhave been writing these, I had to make significant changes in my\nengagement with this varied group of people across age groups and\nprofessions. It involved moving the narrative from tech-centric\nwrite-ups to a simplified language and also increased my focus on\nnavigational skills in this ever changing world. A lot of write-ups on\n'Thought Leadership' as a result.\n\n**Outcomes:** The process gives me many things: discipline, commitment,\nstaying connected with my network, drive to learn new things, write\ncode, using the AI tools of the new era and a stronger ability to have\ngreater conversations in this ever changing landscape.\n\nI take pride in marking this milestone with my **100th** write-up today\nwith a deep sense of gratitude for all your readership, feedback, your\nintrospections and sharing more ideas to navigate in this complex\nlandscape of life."

    "content": "**The Crowded Space (Refresher):** Many of you have used chatGPT, which\nis one the most popular Large Language Models. HuggingFace.com, the\nmarketplace for chatGPT and other LLMs hosts hundreds of thousands of\nsuch models. Including Small and Medium models, the site hosts over 1.5M\nmodels. Here are some popular LLMs:\n\nFollowing OpenAI ChatGPT release in late 2020, Llama (by Meta in Feb\n'23), Claude (by Anthropic in Mar '23), Bard which got rebranded as\nGemini (by Google in Mar '23), Perplexity (by Perplexity AI in Oct '23),\nGrok (by Musk in Nov '23) and DeepSeek the newest, cheapest and latest\nChinese entrant in Jan '25.\n\n**Model Progression:** The models have progressed to build\nmulti-modality to input text, voice, images and to generate text, voice,\nimages, and videos in response. Remember the two dimensions here of the\nmodels: multi-modality and the generative nature of these models making\nthem very powerful over time.\n\n-   The operator mode of the LLMs can execute task like grocery ordering\n    > or travel booking autonomously by handing complex multistep\n    > processes without any human intervention\n\n-   The operator mode can also generate powerful graphical user\n    > interfaces and integration of third-party tools like Google\n    > Workspace, Slack or Microsoft Office\n\n-   In addition to the operator mode, the models have also developed\n    > reasoning abilities to decompose a problem into multiple steps\n    > with chain of thoughts or tree of thoughts logic.

One element is to understand the\ncomprehension and the competition in the space and the other is to\nsimplify integration of these models in real-life scenarios.\n\n**Orchestration:**\n\n-   Imagine as a doctor, if you would like to leverage your specific\n    > patient's history, or anonymously leveraging all your patients'\n    > interactions and combining them with powerful knowledge from\n    > research books. You can selectively generative capabilities of\n    > LLMs to leverage this knowledge and get many more perspectives\n    > invisible to the human eye/brain\n\n-   In other examples, marketer can build the same leverage with a\n    > campaign, repository of all campaigns or industry knowledge to\n    > generate more intelligence leveraging LLMs\n\n-   Same theory applies to Software Developer's knowledgebase, a Tutor\n    > and her notes, a Storyteller and her stories, and many more use\n    > cases\n\nThe **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) is an open standard introduced by\nAnthropic in November 2024 to enable seamless integration between AI\nsystems and external tools or data sources. MCP (no males involved\nhere - just the model) eliminates the need for custom integrations by\nproviding a universal framework, allowing large language models (LLMs)\nto securely access real-time context and interact with diverse systems\nlike databases, APIs, and content repositories as mentioned in the\nexamples above.\n\nHere is the depiction of such a process where you right hand side could\nbe any form of knowledge and tools that can feed that knowledge into the\nLLMs\n\n![](media/image6.png){width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.333333333333333in\"}\n\n**The Future:** This landscape is getting far more comprehensive and\ncompetitive. Not many of the LLM companies are making proportionate\nrevenue for the cost of infrastructure in deploying these models. The\nhope for the future still remains bullish and perhaps AGI (Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence) will change the game.\n\n**What is in it for me?** In discussing these opportunities, I come\nacross a handful of naysayers. A technology leader refuses to use these\ncapabilities as she wants her employees to understand the underlying\nlayers of programming before the employees can use these answer sheets\nor co-pilot coders.\n\nIt took me back to my engineering years and possibly some of you can\nrelate to the same. High-schools are teaching a lot of programming\nlanguages and excel workings that we (and many of you) learnt late in\nyour learning cycle.\n\nStudents and Employees need to learn both methodical workings to know\nwhat is under the hood and also exploit tools in a far more proportion\nthat is going to propel the journey. A reminder once again, your job or\nprofession will not be replaced by a machine but it is certainly\nvulnerable to the ones that know how to use AI in the same context. So,\nare you ready?"

So, why this preface?\n\nI want to write about two things based on this narrative: Assurance from\nInsurance and secondly about how we should make decisions.\n\n**Assurance from Insurance:** Common forms of insurance include health\ncoverage, life insurance policies, automobiles and travel insurances.\nMost employers provide coverage for health and life insurances.\nAutomobile insurance is somewhat mandatory across the developed world.\nWe get a sense of assurance from insurances for personal and family's\nwell being to defend from untimely events in life.\n\nWorking (or not working) for an employer, fighting for a promotion in a\ngiven job, to relocate for work, and to make a significant shift in your\nprofessional life involve a certain amount of risk taking, as we\nconstantly seek assurances. These risk avoiding behaviors reflect on the\nneed for insurance to make decisions. Most always we make decisions in\nfavor of materialistic outcomes and as such there is nothing wrong with\nit.\n\nAt this point, let's think about our cognitive (in)abilities that lead\nus to making certain choices.\n\n**Decision Making:** We often have these deja vu moments and possible\nregrets regarding new products (it was my idea), investments (I knew\nthis company isn't going to do well), relationships (I knew from the\nbeginning they were not meant for each other) and a long list of things.\n\nWe come across a lot of information and decision crossroads to pick an\noption from many. We decide for\n\n-   Academic path to follow (specific stream and levels to get the\n    > Master's or Doctorate)\n\n-   Mode of employment and the associated employer(s)\n\n-   Rent or Buy a property\n\n-   Choosing a life partner\n\n-   Investments we make and a lot more\n\nHere is a perspective to not have a long list of regrettable things. I\nwas advising a founder CTO last week regarding how to introduce AI in\ntheir product and business operations. The leader of this company (the\nCEO) is in hyper growth mode primarily focusing on selling their high in\ndemand product to new customers. Being a start-up there is not much\nappetite to make huge investments for introducing AI/LLM capabilities.\n\nI suggested that the CTO employ a simple model with her leadership team\n(the details in the parenthesis which is specific guidance from me to\nher and may be slightly technical in nature so ignore them based on your\nreadership):\n\n-   **Build a model that shows options or choices** (4 Choices: Radical\n    > or Incremental introduction of AI in operational and product\n    > capabilities in this instance)\n\n-   **Make a recommendation** (Recommending a feature set introduction\n    > that leveraged AI/LLM, specifically Agentic RAG, capability in one\n    > of their product lines and introducing AI enablement in the\n    > operational world, in this instance - this would give a jump\n    > start)\n\n-   **Recommend investments and advantages from making this choice**\n    > (Upkeep within the industry, Competitive landscape and definitive\n    > product advantages in this instance)\n\n-   **Outcomes from not making this choice** (dilution in competitive\n    > rigor, in this instance)\n\n-   **Risks associated** (A slightly longer product cycle to begin with,\n    > in this instance)\n\nIf at first this model or the approach is rejected, go back in 45 days\nclearly indicating what we lost from inaction. The rationale for\nrecommendations can include some or all of the following in the\ndescending order of priority: What we do will positively disrupt our\nworld, increase revenue/profitability, save resources (money, headcount,\nand time), and significantly enhance life experiences.\n\nIn utilizing this model, don't apply this to make small decisions.\nImagine if you had such a comprehensive workflow to decide on which\nflavor of ice cream to eat.\n\nSome more 'To Dos' and 'Don\\'ts'\n\n**Do**\n\n-   Be cognitively super-aware of size and impact of the decisions\n\n-   Read and research similar historical data points\n\n-   Predict what the future holds for the world around us\n\n-   Make sure the time is right and remember it is never too late\n\n-   Ensure your basics are protected (Capital protection, Family\n    > wellbeing etc.)\n\n-   Have a sense of gratitude towards what you already have accomplished\n\n**Do not**\n\n-   Follow the crowd\n\n-   Let someone decide for you\n\n-   Do not sweat on small decisions - eat your ice cream and make sure\n    > to burn it down\n\n-   Accept your surrounding and live with mediocrity\n\n-   buy Insurance for everything at the cost of not experimenting\n\nThere is a lot more however I am breaking here to grab my cappuccino,\nlet's add cocoa powder as well."

Many considerations are required beyond economic growth.\nClear skies and clean air in some geographies will not prevent natural\ncalamities around the planet.\n\nThe planet does not benefit from the big becoming bigger. It does not\nbenefit from the increased gap between number 1 and number 2, number 2\nand number 3. Citizens of the world need to survive from wars and\npandemics. We do not need this price (tariff) war right now on top of\neverything."

    "content": "**Making peace with AI:[C]{.underline}onflicts and Human Touch:**\n\nBefore I get into the depth of this topic, there is a correlation which\nsome have laughed about: The over-referenced\n**[C]{.underline}**haracterization of powerful words in my life that\nbegin with a \"**C**\".\n\nMy first strategic technology framework from 2010 was based on 4 themes:\n**[C]{.underline}**loud, **[C]{.underline}**onsolidation,\n**[C]{.underline}**ompliance and **[C]{.underline}**ost. The Management\nworkshop that I **[C]{.underline}**onceived as \"Leadership Laboratory\"\nis based on 4 **[C]{.underline}**s: **[C]{.underline}**ustomers,\n**[C]{.underline}**ommunication, **[C]{.underline}**ognizance and\n**[C]{.underline}**harisma. A few more \"**[C]{.underline}**s\" to add\ntoday.\n\n**Technology: [C]{.underline}onflict of [C]{.underline}reativity vs.\n[C]{.underline}ementation/[C]{.underline}omfort:** I saw a podcast\nyesterday where a presenter was sharing concerns about how AI will\npossibly **[C]{.underline}**ement the **[C]{.underline}**reativity of\nthe Human Mind. In another incident, a technology leader was hesitant to\nintroduce 'AI' tools in his company with the fear that his employees\nwould not understand the foundational concepts of technology due to 'AI'\ndriven automation. This fear exists with parents whose children are\nleveraging AI to do homework, all kinds of artists who feel their art\nwill not be appreciated due to AI-generated art, and more. This\n**[C]{.underline}**onflict---technology and AI\n**[C]{.underline}**ementing processes and killing creativity---has\ninduced a lot of reluctance and fear in humans. There is also a fear\nthat AI will make humans more **[C]{.underline}**omfortable and lonely\nas a result. Fear arising from excessive use of (Ro)bots in our lives\nleading to **[C]{.underline}**omfort in loneliness.\n\n**Distinguishing Internet, [C]{.underline}loud and AI:** They certainly\nevolved in the order of their mention. We have been using the internet\nfrom the early 1990s to search and to access a lot of information from\nthe WWW (World Wide Web). Similarly the **[C]{.underline}**loud became\npopular from 2008 onwards. A simple example of **[C]{.underline}**loud\nis in accessing your emails. You may not have been a creator in the\ncloud era, however all of us are definite consumers of the cloud.\n\nAI is different. Imagine these three vectors: Individualism,\nIndustrialism and Information Technology stack.\n\n-   As an Individual AI is far more accessible for both creation and\n    > consumption. You can become far more productive and competitive as\n    > an AI user in your personal capacity\n\n-   Industrial growth will accelerate from AI: Automobile, Agriculture,\n    > Manufacturing, Healthcare and all you can name. Combination of\n    > Data, Robotics, AI and other technologies will provide hyper\n    > acceleration in social and economic reforms built in these\n    > industries\n\n-   Leveraging AI in the Information Technology stack to build\n    > disruptive applications is inevitable\n\nThis narrative necessitates confrontation with AI, and in the absence of\nthat, you will lose your edge as an individual, industrialist or\ntechnologist without this embracement.\n\n**Are you [C]{.underline}onflicted with this AI intimidation?**\n\nIf yes then read on. If not then ask why not? Dealing with any conflict\nneeds dissection.\n\n-   Firstly, build **[C]{.underline}**ourage to define your conflict.\n    > Know what has led you to avoid this, both as acknowledgement and\n    > awareness\n\n-   Second phase is to build **[C]{.underline}**uriosity after\n    > **[C]{.underline}**ourageously **[C]{.underline}**onfronting. Ask\n    > questions to know why the conflict began in the first place. What\n    > stopped you from addressing this so far?

It is a\nprocess to take a pause from the ordinary and see how you will change a\nfew ways of working with AI or if you are a newbie to AI then how this\ncan all start in a very refreshing way.\n\n**AI: 'in Action' or 'Inaction':** Following my rant on AI conflicts and\nhuman touch last week, here is some more. Imagine if AI can become\npowerful to understand your context, your intent and very particularly\nthe tone of your voice. How can you better collaborate with AI? This is\nwith an assurance that it will not kill your creativity, unlike the\nobvious fears, but make you more creative.\n\nIf you are a non-technical professional and want to collaborate better\nwith Generative AI (ChatGPT and her cousins) then this is for you. By\nthe way, we now give this recognition to chatGPT so she can now have\nidentity (She/Her) on her LinkedIn account. If you are a technical\nprofessional then you can use this point of view for yourself and/or to\ninspire other non-technical associates, professionals or not. This\nprocess can dramatically augment and amplify your creativity.\n\n-   Instead of asking direct questions to LLMs, we should ask LLMs first\n    > to say, 'What is the best way for me to ask this question to AI\n    > for it to answer it well?' You see the point and if you do not\n    > read this again\n\n-   With this you can now ask 'AI to use AI' as opposed to how we could\n    > not use Excel to use Excel, which would have sounded oxymoronic in\n    > the years\n\n-   Ask AI (ChatGPT or any of her cousin) to find how I can best\n    > leverage AI: Ask AI to ask you enough questions till it\n    > understands your responsibilities, workflows, and KPIs (Key\n    > Performance Indicators)\n\n-   After she has learnt about you, now ask her to make two obvious and\n    > two not-so obvious recommendations\n\n-   Given the neuronic being of LLMs/AI, it will continuously assess her\n    > own work.

I have a\ndistribution list of people that I send these thoughts to by email.\n\nI decided to improvise the initially created 'Sunday Thoughts' portal\nusing AI tools to accelerate and simplify the distribution process. In\naddition, preceding the distribution a lot goes in organizing the\ncontent intricately, again using AI tools. Here are some more details on\nhow the AI engine helps me to do my job. Some parts are repeated here\nfrom my past update however without them it will not give a holistic\nview of the process\n\n**Content Organization**\n\n![](media/image18.png){width=\"5.463542213473316in\"\nheight=\"3.642361111111111in\"}\n\n-   I created an API (Application Programming Interface - an automated\n    > way to summon chatGPT from my software code) to access ChatGPT in\n    > its operator mode\n\n-   I asked chatGPT to write a python script (python is a popular\n    > programming/scripting language) by first taking the large\n    > monolithic file of 100+ articles and dividing it into individual\n    > pdf files, using author date as a delimiter. 30 seconds later I\n    > had the individual pdf files\n\n-   I created a repository on Supabase/Postgres database portal (similar\n    > to Google drive but with specialization for accessing data in a\n    > specific format) to store my data and the content files (Images,\n    > Writeups, and more)\n\n-   Database stores information of my subscribers with basic user\n    > profile and a separate table (just like an excel sheet) for my\n    > write ups to track article title, creation date, document name,\n    > image file for the article, article pdf file name, formatted write\n    > up for web rendering, category of the writeup as mentioned in the\n    > four categories (Technology/AI, Macroeconomics, Thought Leadership\n    > and Geopolitics), determining if the content is dated in terms of\n    > time relevance or ageless and lastly tracking comments of my\n    > readers\n\n-   I created another file store on Supabase to save images for the\n    > write ups, pdf file of the writeups, and audio version of the AI\n    > generated podcast\n\n-   I asked chatGPT to write another python script to take each of the\n    > generated pdfs read them using the operator mode and process each\n    > of them in the following way:\n\n    -   Give an AI generated title for the document\n\n    -   Identify category combination based on the content in the\n        > writeup\n\n    -   Asked chatGPT to generate an image that can best represent this\n        > article\n\n    -   Save the created date\n\n    -   Take all the generated and known data for each of the files\n        > subsequently to create an entry in my database to use it for\n        > my distribution portal\n\n**Content Distribution**\n\n![](media/image17.png){width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.6944444444444446in\"}\n\n-   This part is for my portal for content distribution.

This is a prediction that,\nvery soon, we will likely have Unicorns run by a single individual.\nLet's say that, at least in today's times, I have seen half a dozen\nfounders running enterprises valued over \\$1B+. Yes, just 6 employees in\nthe company.\n\nCutting-edge technology has empowered a selective, small group of people\nto generate enormous amounts of wealth or valuation. This has, and will\ncontinue to, introduce greater disparities in the wealth distribution.\nHere is a quick view of the global wealth and GDP evolution across the\npast four Industrial Revolutions.\n\nI.  Invention of the Steam Engine enabled a lot of factories and\n    > automation in the second half of the 18th century and first half\n    > of the 19th. The global GDP was tracked at roughly \\$500B at that\n    > point in time. 90% of the national wealth was held by 10% of the\n    > British population, with Britain being at the forefront of the\n    > growth curve\n\nII.

The global GDP was\n    > tracked at \\$2.7T at that point in time, roughly 5.5 times that of\n    > the first revolution.

In the 4th revolution, technology continues to dominate, and the\n    > global GDP grew to \\$110T+ as projected for this year. The world\n    > order remains somewhat challenged - the US still leads the pack\n    > however, the future will most likely have the world order\n    > leadership somewhat divided\n\n**Democracy and Communism:**\n\nIn a nutshell, Democracy is a political system, and Communism is built\naround economic and political ideologies. Here are some key differences\nbetween the two:\n\n1.  In a democracy, multiple political parties compete, compared to a\n    > single party communist ruling\n\n2.  Democratic nations have largely capitalistic approach, and Communism\n    > is built around collective or state based ownership, largely\n    > controlled by few individuals over a long span of time\n\n3.  Communism aims to create a classless society and largely suppresses\n    > freedom (speech) to retain the state's ideology\n\n4.  You can compare democratic nations like the US, India, Japan and\n    > Germany to countries based on Communist ideologies like North\n    > Korea, Cuba, Russia and China\n\nNow, imagine a triangle with Government as one vertex, Industries as the\nsecond and People as the third. Wealth is largely generated through\nindustrial revolutions, which is accrued and consumed by people, and\nsomehow regularized by the Government through policies and taxes. Each\nvertex helps maintain balance in this triangle by pulling or pushing to\nmake an ideal equilateral triangle. However, between the industries,\nindividuals, and geographies, the representations of these triangles can\noften become scalene.\n\nDemocratic nations are largely capitalist in nature. Sometimes,\nCommunist countries try to simulate 'Capitalist' behaviors to create a\npeople and industry led growth mindset. This is actually a dangerous\napproach. Look at what happened to Alibaba and Jack Ma following their\nrespective growth in PRC (People's Republic of China).\n\n**Socialism: Collective ownership leading to equality, welfare and\nregulated markets**\n\nBy definition, socialism can exist in both Democratic and Communist\nnations. They use policies to bring parity in well-being through\nprogressive taxation, universal healthcare, education and pensions.\n\n**How should the employment and wealth imbalance from AI disruption be\nmanaged? Is UBI (Universal Basic Income) the answer?**\n\nJust go back to the triangle of Industries, People and the Government.\nWhen we have excessive wealth and power imbalances, the world will\nbecome more aggressive and revolutionary.\n\nTo prevent that, there should/will be governmental intervention.\nAlthough desirable, 'Universal Basic Income' is a very hard state to\nachieve. This is why?\n\n-   \"Universal\" applies to all humans, and given the unique powers,\n    > resources, and technological advances of each of the countries, we\n    > will continue to live in the imbalances\n\n-   People have wealth inherited and generated over centuries and\n    > decades. This cannot be disrupted\n\n-   Giving free money has never been a good sign. In the COVID years, a\n    > lot of the stimulus funding was abused for luxuries or substances\n\nThis only means that the third vertex of the triangle, in the form of\ngovernment, will have to create an amenable social structure through\neducation, healthcare, subsidies and taxation. The disruption from the\nnew age tech revolution is inevitable, and only time will determine the\nlevel of impact it will create in inequitable wealth distribution.\nHopefully, common sense will prevail as it has for the centuries."

    "content": "\"Gut feelings\" are instincts arising from the brain-gut connection. Gut\nmicrobiome influences our emotions and decisions, triggering\nsubconscious brain responses, mostly irrational. Gut itself is as big as\nthe brain of a dog or a cat and hosts 500 million neurons which send\nsignals to the brain.\n\n**So, why talk about the Gut Feelings to start with?**\n\nFirstly, to understand what we mean by gut feelings, and secondly to\nbuild awareness in order to manage our anxiety from the subconsciousness\nthat gut feelings create. Most mental uncertainties are from the fear\nthat originates from anxieties, largely initiated by the gut. In\nreality, when we are in fear, we tend to give up what we really want.\nWhat do we give up and what are some of the actions attached to not\ngiving up? This writeup was inspired by this short ted talk so here is\nthe quick reference for credit.\n\n[[https://youtu.be/bRtBHF-WPpM?si=dZHXDMpdaZhr9-mp]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/bRtBHF-WPpM?si=dZHXDMpdaZhr9-mp)\n\n**Unfolding the Process of Wants**\n\nWe often find ourselves in a wrong job, uncertain relationships, and\navoidance of medical diagnosis, all of which result in a prolonged\nprocrastination. Something that holds us captive in the avoidance mode.\n\nOf all the things that I could gather from the podcast, doing a\n'Self-Audit' stayed with me the strongest.\n\n**What does the audit entail**? Many dimensions - mental state, health,\nrelationships, materialistic expectations, my excuses and a long list of\nthings.\n\nWe often tend to use excuses to defend our avoidance. Excuses of impact\non children from a toxic marriage, excuses for financial needs to be\nfulfilled while working for an incompetent leader and I am sure you have\nyour reasons for specific avoidances in your pocket. The underlying\nthought of, 'I am in the wrong place', does not go away.\n\n**How do you conduct a self-audit?**\n\n1.  In the list of your wants (what do I want part), identify the pivot\n    > of the decision - decision of your career, a given job,\n    > relationship, or health perspectives, whatever it might be?\n\n2.  Do an exercise just like you would in a fish bone analysis. If you\n    > are unfamiliar with a fish bone map then just look it up or\n    > perhaps I can write about it in future\n\n3.  As you identify dependencies around your want, determine if these\n    > dependencies are not your additional wants as well. Sometimes\n    > working for an incompetent leader or being in a toxic relationship\n    > for non-negotiable monetary expectations, play a tug of war\n\n4.

This\nis painful however it will also provide you a launching pad for a\nquantum leap.\n\nLastly, ensure that the audit does not get you into daily\nanalysis-paralysis syndrome. Engage with the outcomes of the audit and\ncool down until the next audit, which cannot happen until another\nsignificant milestone in your life."

My\nimmediate response was that I would have paid him a handsome amount to\nask the question, not getting into the specificity of the questions for\ntoday's topic. I was excited as I had conspired some questions that were\noff-topic.\n\nOne of the hardest things is in prepping for a big presentation to the\nexecutives or for a talk to a large group. \"Watch your thoughts, they\nbecome words; watch your words, they become actions\" and simply to put\nin action instead of just watching, conspiring with these can actually\nhelp you accelerate.\n\n**Conspiring in the \"Magical Kingdom\" of Mind**\n\nBreadth and Depth in knowledge are equally important.

Once you start\nwriting it will help you to standardize, deduplicate, organize and most\nimportantly discard the material you do not find relevant. Just to write\nthese thoughts, I plug all my research material and then start\ndiscarding elements that are relatively duplicative or irrelevant as I\nprogress through the page(s).\n\n**Rehearsing and Presenting the Narrative**\n\nA little bit on how you can build confidence with your articulation.

    "content": "Did you ever get a lower than expected performance review or a poor\ngrade in your assessment? How did that happen and what were the impacts?\nThis has exactly happened similarly to the US credit rating recently.\nRay Dalio, a great economist of our times, beautifully explains\n[[this]{.underline}](https://substack.com/@marketsentiment/note/c-119362970)\nin 90 seconds and the write-up below drills a little more.\n\n**Downgrade of US' Credit Sovereign Rating**: With Moody's downgrade of\ncredit sovereign rating from AAA to AA1, as of May 2025, the United\nStates no longer holds a top-tier sovereign credit rating. This happened\nlargely on three counts:\n\n-   The U.S. national debt has reached approximately \\$36 trillion and\n    > is projected to increase further in the coming years. For\n    > definition, this debt is the amount the US government owes from\n    > borrowing to cover deficits. Debt is largely due to funds raised\n    > from the public, foreign and institutional investors in the form\n    > of Bonds.

Naturally, when you spend more than\n    > how much you earn, it will have several implications\n\n-   You may have heard about the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', which is\n    > expected to be enacted by July 4, is currently under review of the\n    > US senate, and will significantly change the fiscal game.

This will necessitate tjat government\nto increase the yields (interest payments). When the yield on the bonds\nincreases, it will have two effects:\n\n-   You are paying a higher interest payment for the bonds, so you will\n    > pay more to service the debt. This explains the push to raise the\n    > debt ceiling by \\$4T\n\n-   This will also push the central banks (Federal Reserve) to increase\n    > or maintain the interest rate for general borrowings\n\nAdditional downstream impact, which is not significantly evident yet,\ncan happen on the following sectors:\n\n-   **Equity Markets**: Corporate borrowing will be discouraged and risk\n    > appetite to invest in equity markets can further dilute,\n    > especially in the interest rate sensitive segments like\n    > Real-Estate, Utilities and Growth Tech\n\n-   **Currency**: This can weaken the exchange rate of the US dollar,\n    > however there is also a counter that due to its nature as a\n    > standard reserve currency of the US dollar, it might rise to\n    > manage global risks. This can also lead to printing of more\n    > dollars domestically to fulfill the demand side from the increased\n    > supply of bonds\n\n-   **Gold**: This may increase investor optimism for gold and other\n    > hard assets, leading to an increase in price of these commodities\n\nWhile the downgrades reflect concerns about the U.S. fiscal position, we\nhave seen limited immediate impact on financial markets. U.S. Treasury\nsecurities continue to be viewed as safe assets due to the country\\'s\nstrong economic fundamentals and the dollar\\'s role as the global\nreserve currency. The US' GDP is still \\$10T+ greater than its next\nrival in China.\n\nThe downgrades serve as a warning signal, highlighting the need for\npolicymakers to address the nation\\'s fiscal challenges proactively.\n\nSo coming back to where we started, when you get a small ding in your\nperformance review or your grades in academia, just look at it as a\nwarning cycle and build a path to recovery. This points me to yet\nanother great remark by Adam Grant stating,\n\n> **\"The most underrated career skill is the ability to receive tough\n> love. Acquiring knowledge is easy. Obtaining constructive criticism is\n> hard. If you can\\'t handle the truth, people stop telling you the\n> truth.\\\n> The people who grow the most are the ones who take feedback the\n> best.\"**"

This impact is\ncoming through the advent of AI agents. An AI agent leverages reasoning\nability, remembrance/memory and workflow automation tools to conduct\nhuman-like business as an advanced employee would. The ability to\nreason, plan and take action based on information it's given, this AI\nagent simulating a digital employee thinks, remembers and gets things\ndone. There are three parts to this:\n\n-   Presence of brain is demonstrated through the effective use of LLMs\n    > which are used for reasoning, planning and language generation\n\n-   Memory in the form of datasets and history of past interactions\n    > allows tracking of continuity and successful results to take\n    > future action\n\n-   Finally, the AI agent will use tools like Email, Workflow Tools and\n    > other new age technologies to interact with the outside world\n\nA simple example is a Customer Service Agent. Compared to Generative\nAI-based internship-like behaviours, an AI agent is trained with\ncustomers, products, and several scenarios to support customers just\nlike a human-based agent would work with the customers. There is also\nthe ability to remember past interactions for reference and for training\nas any human agent would have. At some point in the near future, I want\nto create an example AI agent which I will look forward to sharing with\na real-life example.\n\n**I don't have time to understand and use these AI Agents?** On average,\nas a working professional we attend 15 meetings every week and\nadditionally spend 1/3rd of our time responding to emails or chat\nmessages. Also account for time spent on distractions and social media.\nThis busy bee mindset numbs us out and prevents us from finding real\nfreedom --- creating space to take a break, to think, and to innovate.\nThis perceived burnout leads to 4 million people quitting their rat-race\njobs every month in the United States.\n\nThe good thing is between Digitization, AI and pandemic, we have gotten\nbetter. Our productivity has increased with many organizations moving\ntowards a 4-day work week, explicitly or implicitly. This has been\nexperimented with reduced time at work in Spain, Scotland, Norway,\nDenmark, US, Ireland, France and Germany. Certain jobs that are low\npaying in nature or certain cultures where a long working hours mindset\nis a dominant aspect are finding it hard to change.\n\nIt is imperative that you figure out ways to make yourself more\nefficient through effective meeting management, time management and\ninvestment in using the new age tools.\n\n**Thoughts courtesy of these podcasts:\\\n** [https://youtu.be/dr1-fPkTxZM?si=dOS4i3-tUa9470Uj\\\n](https://youtu.be/dr1-fPkTxZM?si=dOS4i3-tUa9470Uj)\n[https://youtu.be/MyVfUaXyyqo?si=ou1zNRAn2ut3X3Xx\\\n](https://youtu.be/MyVfUaXyyqo?si=ou1zNRAn2ut3X3Xx)\n<https://youtu.be/uPZs_gAxfjM?si=hsIg8q6BDsXGRDPH>"

    "content": "As a young person, are your parents critical about your excessive\nspending habits? If you are a parent, do you feel that your children do\nnot understand the value of money? Are our spending and money management\nhabits a function of upbringing, culture around us, geography, parental\ninfluences, next gen or just unique to us? Possibly, some combination of\nthese. However, in addition, our spending behaviours, wealth creation,\nand money management are intrinsically determined by many factors\nunknown to us. Here is a deep dive\n\n**Savings, Consumption and Wealth creation abilities around the world:**\n\n-   Here is a simple list representing average savings rate from earned\n    > 100 currency units for various countries: \\~5% for an American,\n    > \\~35% for a Chinese, \\~18% for an Indian, 6% in the UK and 10-15%\n    > in Japan & Germany\n\n-   Consumption & Spendings by the individuals determine growth of GDP\n    > (Gross Domestic Product) by definition. Higher the spend, higher\n    > the GDP\n\n-   China, structured as a communist nation, conspires via a state\n    > directed capitalist economy. In a nutshell, Chinese government\n    > determines year over year directional spends to determine sectors\n    > for economic growth\n\n-   Earlier mention of high savings rate in China reduces consumption\n    > within the economy. This forces the government to make investments\n    > in sectors like factories, infrastructure, automation (EVs) and\n    > real estate to push for GDP growth\n\n-   Top 4 Banks in the world are based in China and they hold \\$20T+ in\n    > assets more than what the country makes in a year. China's\n    > property market is about \\$130T in value\n\n-   Comparatively, an average American saves only 5% for what she earns.\n    > With less than 4% of the global population, Americans spend 1 out\n    > of 3 dollars across the planet making it the largest consuming\n    > economy.\n\n**What encourages us to Spend & Consume vs. Save & Invest?**\n\n-   China, for example, has bigger challenges from poverty, famines and\n    > crisis management. Citizens don't trust the government and as a\n    > result they are pushed to save\n\n-   Owning real estate in some countries like India and China is a\n    > status symbol. Owning a home can be a prerequisite to marriage\n\n-   Social security (Post retirement care) in these countries is not\n    > reliable and healthcare is not accessible with ease\n\n-   China manufactures 20 billion pieces of clothing with 1.4 billion\n    > people citizens, has housing to accommodate 3 billion citizens,\n    > has over built road and rail network, manufactures 4.5 billion\n    > appliances annually, produces 1.4 billion cell phones annually,\n    > manufactures steel enough to fulfill half the world's demand,\n    > produces EVs in large quantities and manufactures with an export\n    > orientation. This as such does not help its citizens as such but\n    > tries to drive growth with potential economic downturns\n\n-   Comparatively, consumer confidence for larger nations in the Western\n    > hemisphere is high. US leads the way in consumer spending, as\n    > mentioned earlier\n\n-   60% of Americans own stocks. The UK and Japan have 30%+ investors in\n    > the stock market. Similarly, India is moving in this direction.\n    > Investments in China are a bit more conservative focusing more on\n    > real-estate and savings, away from its stock market\n\n-   Countries printing of currency for citizens based consumption are\n    > far more effective compared to countries like China that print\n    > currencies to drive controlled/politicized economic growth\n\nAt large, spending habits of most Eastern hemisphere countries are\nrelatively conservative. Additionally, State run economies like China\nreduce faith of the citizens in the nation's intent on individual level\nwealth creation, forcing their citizens to save more. A lot of these\ncountries and economies acknowledge prosperity but do not make use of it\nas they prosper.\n\n**In Conclusion:** When citizens feel protected, educated, insured, and\nwith the convenience of infrastructure, they are encouraged to spend &\nconsume more. In another example, Berkshire Hathaway a U.S.-based\nmultinational conglomerate holding company led by Warren Buffett, holds\nassets in excess of \\$900B with only 5-7% of \\$900B invested outside of\nthe US. They feel very confident about being protected with how the\ncountry is governed at large.\n\nAs individuals, our consumption and spending at large is driven by\neconomic comfort and less by habits or culture. Incremental policy\nreforms in growing economies lead to increased incomes and spending as a\nresult, which remain invisible to us in a way. Countries with\nstagnated/rigid policy framework and corrupted state will have an impact\non both, the wellbeing of the citizens and the economic growth. These\nnations will have to relinquish control to private companies and improve\ntheir policy reforms significantly in order to prosper.\n\nIf you have incrementally grown your incomes, built the ability to\ninvest and feel more confident about the future then be assured that you\nare in the right place. Be thankful!\n\n[[https://youtu.be/X06ynCq0Pcg?si=cLMhi7yftMbWbyEi]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/X06ynCq0Pcg?si=cLMhi7yftMbWbyEi)\n\n[[https://www.costco.com/franklin-floor-lamp.product.100719786.html]{.underline}](https://www.costco.com/franklin-floor-lamp.product.100719786.html)\n\n\\$64M per day YouTube royalties paid to people; YouTube ate TV;"

The disciplines? **Noise Pollution**, **Commuting by\nCrowded Mumbai Local Trains**, **Space Management** (my 140 Sq Ft\nMansion --- yes, you read it right), **Social Inequality** (answering a\nphone meant a five-storey climb and descent), **Identity Crisis** (Can I\nbring friends over to my big fancy house?), and **Social (In)equality on\nDisplay**, just to name a few.\n\nOf course, those who came from small towns had their own decathlon ---\nperhaps with issues of **infrastructure**, **power supply**, **access to\nhigh-speed internet**, and other obstacles specific to their\nenvironment.\n\n### **So What? How Does This Matter?** \n\nAmong other things, **your resiliency as a human is defined by your\nupbringing**. Adversity forces you to play life's games like\n*Tug-of-Work* and *Survival-of-the-Fittest*, sharpening your\n**navigational abilities**. There are two parts to this:\n\n1.  **Building upon who you are**\n\n2.  **Defining your continuous being\\\n    > **\n\nAs the strength of a skyscraper lies in its foundation, **your ability\nto withstand professional uncertainty and stand tall through\ncircumstantial storms** is a direct function of how your early\nfoundation was built.\n\nOver time, you accumulate layers of experience --- learning to **deal\nwith failure**, to **stand out**, and most importantly, to **stand\ntall**.\n\n### **What's Your Modus Operandi? Invisibility, *In Visibility*, or *In Visibility for Your Convenience*** \n\nThis is where you pause and reflect on **your own operating model**.\n\nJust two hours ago, I completed a three-hour mandatory harassment\nprevention course. As I reached step 99 out of 100, my browser crashed\n--- everything reset. It felt like being bitten by the snake at square\n93 in a childhood game of *Snakes & Ladders*. I will restart the\ntraining.\n\nBut what does this have to do with your **modus operandi**?\n\n### **There are these three Modes We Operate In** \n\n#### **🥷 'Invisibility' Mode** \n\nIn this mode, I become oblivious to my potential.\\\n\\\"I'm a doctor --- I have enough patients.\\\"\\\n\\\"I run an online market research firm --- I have paying customers.\\\"\\\n\\\"I have a job --- I meet expectations.\\\"\n\nThis gives me just enough growth to keep pace with inflation. I walk\nwith my head high, but I'm playing it safe.\n\n#### **🎭 'In Visibility for My Convenience' Mode** \n\nI become **seasonally relevant**. I build marketing campaigns, push\nthroughput, launch a side project. This allows **non-standard growth**\n--- maybe 2--3x inflation. I tap into my early-life Olympic resilience\nbut **only when I feel like it**. I use compounding, and it feels\ngood... but it's not my best game.\n\n#### **🏅 Pureplay 'In Visibility' Mode** \n\nThis is where the game changes. Your goal is no longer just money. You\npush boundaries, step out of your comfort zone, and run a decathlon\nevery day.\n\nFans of *Better Call Saul* will remember when Saul Goodman offered 50%\ndiscounts to drug offenders --- low margins, high volume. That's pure\nhustle.\n\nThis is where:\n\n-   You create **new solutions for new markets**\n\n-   You test **unique ideas with confidants** before launching big\n\n-   You operate in **full visibility**, not just for your personal\n    > convenience\n\nLike Rishabh Pant, who failed miserably in the IPL but scored\n**back-to-back test centuries** --- it's not about the wins; it's about\nthe **attitude to go again**.\n\n### **Go for the GOLD:** Your resilience and shaping didn't happen overnight --- they came from years of silent perseverance. \n\nNow ask yourself: \"Am I truly playing in full visibility mode, or am I\njust conveniently visible?\" Search your soul."

I know of 100s of my colleagues who could advent into\nthe world of software without much of a formal education. They\nsuccessfully have made a mark in the software and the SaaS space today\nleveraging some basic training and through experiential learning. This\nera is repeating and worth exploring how.\n\nA big difference between the 90s and today is in the fact that the\ndemand for software professionals was higher then than compared to the\nease with which software can be written now. Let's examine how.\n\n**Software 1.0:** In this era, from client-server to very sophisticated\nSaaS evolution, you wrote code in English like software languages to\ninstruct the computer(s) in the form of software programs. Easy enough.\n\n**Software 2.0:** Imagine a Computer based AI chess player that is\nplaying a game against a grandmaster chess champion. Obviously, when the\ncomputer is playing the game it is not programmed to remember all\npossible combinations for moves of chess pieces. It uses a technique\ncalled unsupervised learning where your computer is managed in the form\nof a neural network. Neural network has something called weights which\nare programmed to respond with chess moves. Evolution of self-driving\ncars is based similarly where the neural capacity of a Full Self-Driving\nmode uses the objects (other vehicles, traffic signals, people), the\nroad dividing lines and the lanes to create a neurological response to\ndrive the car.\n\n**Software 3.0:** I believe Software 2.0 is a slightly complicated\nrepresentation that gets simplified here. Imagine that your computer is\nnow replaced by Large Language Models. You provide instructions in the\nform of prompts to program and fine tune the model to get answers. This,\nas you all have experienced by now, is in the form of English language\ninteractions.\n\nAs a new entrant in the AI space or as a graduating student, you need to\nknow how Software 1.0 existed and how you can fully exploit the power of\nSoftware 3.0. Soham Parekh, a young and slightly misguided software\nenthusiast, did exactly this without keeping focus on one-thing and got\ndistracted in the process.\n\nAndrej Karpathy, ex-Director of AI and Auto Pilot vision at Tesla, has\nbeautifully explained these and some more AI concepts in this referenced\n[[talk]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?si=i3CUw5QA_mpMGlkX)\nwhile addressing students who are at the verge of entering professional\nlife.\n\nIn his words LLMs/AI are like power that is needed for our existence.\nThis is a utility that needs a large Capital Expenditure investment\n(build LLMs equivalent to building a power plant), its consumers needing\nOperational Expenditure (Consume Power or Pay for tokens in the LLMs\ncontext), need stability (power to be highly available), with no latency\n(Light bulb glows as soon as turn the switch on), and with multiple LLMs\n(Llama, OpenAI, Claude) just like getting power from your power grid,\nbattery, solar or oil based generators. In a nutshell LLMs are\nequivalent to electricity.\n\n**In conclusion:** With LLMs, everyone is a programmer, as most of us\nspeak English - a natural language. You don't need to study software\nengineering to be able to program. He tweeted with a meme themed as\n'Vibe Coding'. You blabber to the LLM, ignore long wielded assessment,\nignore a lot of meaning behind the code, keep talking the machine just\nlike a 5th grader till it produces code for your purpose. Virality of\nthe meme actually created a wikipedia entry on \"Vibe Coding\". Here are\nthe snapshots of his tweet and the Wiki page.\n\n**Vibe Coding Tweet:**\n\n![](media/image19.png){width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.416666666666667in\"}\n\n**The Wiki reference it deserved:**\n\n![](media/image20.png){width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.75in\"}"

This bullshit exists\neverywhere, and this write-up will build a certain level of cognizance\nand appetite to deal with it.\n\n### **Toxic Culture that is Devoid of Meaning** \n\nHave you come across situations where leaders often say:\n\n-   *\"Let's circle back\"* when they have no idea what to say at a given\n    > point\n\n-   *\"We need to be agile\"* so you can get \\$#!+ done without asking for\n    > guidance, budget, or more time\n\n-   *\"Think outside the box\"* and tell me what I would like to hear\n\n-   *\"We need to empower our teams\"* so that you are responsible for a\n    > task without any authority on budgets or resources\n\n-   *\"We are on a transformation journey\"* and I have no idea as a\n    > leader what we will achieve --- however, we paid McKinsey a lot of\n    > money to draw a pretty picture and a lot more\n\n-   We are *\"Data Driven\"* or *\"Customer Obsessed\"\\\n    > *\n\nProbably there are a dozen more examples --- and your favorites that you\ncan add to this list. Well, at first, believe me: you are not alone\nlooking to breathe in this kind of a world.\n\n### **AI-led Human Hallucination** \n\nAI has given yet another flavor to this story. When we started the AI\njourney, we quickly realized that early versions of LLMs hallucinated\n**1 out of 6 times** --- saying things like *9.11 is actually greater\nthan 9.9*.\n\nI have seen many podcasts and presentations where corporations are now\ncluelessly aiming to be an *\"AI First\"* company. They speak about using\nAI Agents, Co-Pilots, Model Context Protocols, and AI Applications ---\nwithout having foundational AI strategies.\n\nCompared to the Large Language Model hallucinating 1 out of 6 times,\n**corporations are running like chicken without a head**. Leaders here\nare hallucinating **perhaps more than 60% of the time** --- compared to\n16% by the early LLMs.\n\n### **So, Why does this happen?** \n\nNaturally, everyone wants to be relevant and be strategic in their\nthought leadership. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nThis leads to **\"Feel Good Fairy Dusting\"** --- that complicates your\nthought process **in** this abstracted world. These complicated words,\nthoughts, and messages are far from reality.\n\nThey hear some bits in presentations, from service providers, peer\ngroups, and some events. They bring half-hearted guesswork into the\ncontext of a professional setup.\n\n### **How do you build cognizance, respond, and navigate in such situations?** \n\n-   Culture of the entity where you are an employee, participant,\n    > contributor, or a creator matters a lot.

These companies --- and\ncompanies prior to them or newer non-technological organizations --- are\nall trying to stay relevant in the new AI world.\n\nIf you are part of these organizations or an independent professional,\nthen build your own awareness through use of these tools. Recently, I\nmet many individuals who use the LLMs to do prep accounting work, legal\ngroundwork, or financial research. Their engagement with tax, legal, and\nfinancial professionals **after** the use of these tools is simplified,\naccelerated, and becomes cost-efficient. They leverage the power of\nAI/LLMs for a lot of foundation work, remain savvy, and avoid becoming\n**overly dependent** on specialist professionals.\n\nJargons and generalized inspiration are often used by leaders in their\nconversation. As long as these thoughts are used as conversational\nseasonings, things are okay. **But if they are part of your daily main\ncourse or buffet, then it is time to look for a change.**"

Inner circles are groups of people that find conformity and\ncomfort with each other. They think alike and rub their beliefs and\nenergies off one another. In the process, they build opinions about\nthose who are not part of the circle. A large, complex organization may\nhave many such inner circles.\n\nUnfortunately, the broader organization sees these circles too --- and\ndevelops opinions about them in return. When such groups become\nentrenched over time, they often breed bitterness among people. Hatred\nand lack of trust build over the years, and eventually, this impacts the\nwellbeing of the entire setup. Major projects experience delays, red\ntape, and disharmony from bureaucracies. Organizations suffer financial\nlosses.\n\nAt the same time, I've also seen that in times of crisis --- barring\nextremist mindsets --- people pull together to face challenges. The\nsuccess of such organizations depends on leadership. Let me put a\nsituation in perspective.\n\n### [**[You are (or can be) Contagious]{.underline}**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cef35Fk7YD8) \n\nThis excerpt is from a previous write-up and is relevant here.\n\nWhen you meet a person for the first time, what do you look at?

My team decides to go have a drink. On the way out\nof the office, Amit Kumar --- one of my most celebrated leaders ---\ntakes 10 minutes to greet and wish a good weekend to every colleague he\npasses, including the front desk and security staff.\n\nEveryone waiting is irritated by this uncanny but predictable habit of\nAmit. As irritating as it got for us, Amit is that *contagion* that\npasses the positivity of life around. I've seen more leaders --- but he\nalways stood out.\n\nSome good habits that he (and other good leaders) demonstrate:\n\n-   They make people feel comfortable\n\n-   They check on others: on their wellbeing\n\n-   They decouple time-lapsed or recent biases and focus on the person\n    > in front of them\n\n-   They don't build toxins within --- and this could be a much longer\n    > list\n\n### **Wrong Leaders are Celebrated Often** \n\nAs much as good leaders deserve to be celebrated, we too often see\n**mediocre, incompetent, authoritative leaders** idolized. Why?\n\n-   Sometimes they are celebrated due to **racism or sexism biases\\\n    > **\n\n-   There is the **Action Fallacy** --- we mistake noise for leadership\n\n-   They speak more, so we hear them more --- regardless of content\n\n-   They demonstrate confidence, regardless of competence\n\n-   They pretend to be perpetually busy, no matter the substance\n\n-   They blow their own trumpets and love to recover from the mistakes\n    > *they* caused\n\n-   They are the self-proclaimed **captains of crisis\\\n    > **\n\nThe best way to discover good leaders is to introspect deeply on the\ntraits of both good and bad leadership. Look for leaders who:\n\n-   Don't promote drama\n\n-   Quietly accomplish big missions\n\n-   Show empathy\n\n-   And most importantly, **don't create inner circles\\\n    > **\n\n### **Your Tenancy** \n\nKeeping myself in perspective, I can relate to many of the positive\ntraits above. I am rarely in an inner circle. I demonstrate empathy. I\navoid the action fallacy and resist creating drama.\n\nIn reality, your *tenancy* exists everywhere:\n\n-   Inside the inner circles\n\n-   As an observer of those circles you're not part of\n\n-   As someone who appreciates your good traits\n\n-   As someone who strives to avoid contributing to toxic culture\n\nBut the real question is:\n\n> **Where do you pay the most rent?\\\n> ** In seeking attention --- or in driving results?\\\n> In action fallacy --- or in building a strong premise of integrity?\n\nThe best way to find out where you\\'re living as a tenant?\\\n**Seek honest feedback from people you trust --- the ones who will help\nyou see the mirror.**"

Next holiday, a fancy car,\nbigger home and the list goes on.\n\nThe race is always on and often supplemented by therapy,\nantidepressants, displeasure and anger experienced by loved ones, and\nsometimes futile efforts to calm yourself with meditation, no offense to\nyoga teachers at home or otherwise.\n\nWe become addicts of achievement and constantly look for validation and\napproval from others. Likes on Social Media, Appreciation from\nLeadership, Praises from your workplace.\n\nIn search of this pursuit when people ask us how we are doing, the first\nword that comes to mind is 'Busy'. At what cost? Invariably, our mental\nand physical being are impacted. I have been a victim of this mode. So I\nhave come to terms with some of this and in all honesty, not entirely.\n\n**Tug of War between Efforts and Outcomes:**\n\nAs humans we like to fit in, not create chaos, build tolerance as our\ngoal is to make notional achievements in kind (Promotion 🧑‍💼📈✨, Raise\n💸📈🤑, New Job 💰💎🚀, Social Status 👑🏆). In the context of achieving\nthese notional achievements, we make a lot of upstream efforts where the\ndaily rut far exceeds your tolerance, necessitating a headache pill at\nthe end of each workday.\n\nWhat if contrary to artificially fitting into achieving notional\nachievements, we focus more on doing things that bring joy like playing\na sport, spending more time with friends, painting, cooking, fitness\nregime or traveling. For me personally, I focus on intellectual\nupliftment through my weekend research.\n\nOnce I/we do this, your psychological flow gets really smooth. When you\nare working on a problem (work related or not), your mind will be\nunburdened from the chaos that your expectations create. This\nseamlessness will let you focus on the most productive ways of working.\nDon't expect for what you do in your personal space to create magic in\nyour professional setup as there is more to do:\n\n-   Don't be a Yes (wo)man to begin with\n\n-   Identify the value that your presence brings to a task or a meeting\n\n-   Escape from activities and conversations where you are not adding\n    > value\n\n-   Disconnect Actions from Expected Outcomes\n\n-   Expect outcomes to be byproduct of your actions and not as\n    > foundational goals\n\n-   Avoid doing things that don't matter to your fabric and I am sure\n    > there is more\n\nIf the expected activities compromise your fundamental beliefs then\nchoose a path to decouple from the situation (people, organizations or\ninitiatives)\n\n**Expiry of Tolerance - Let's Move On:** In more than 3 decades of my\ncareer, I have had a few bumpy days. A day when I walked into the office\nunshaven from forgetting to shave, the time when my health parameters\ntook a detour... and ended up at a pizza parlour or when I realized\ncultural toxicity. In all instances, I walked out, including relocating\nto a new geography.\n\nWhile you cannot quit or walk out unreasonably, make conscious choices\nof how you operate on an everyday basis. It is hard to stay away from\nattention addiction so keep assessing to decouple consciously from being\nin that mode.\n\nInspiration credits\n[[https://youtu.be/S8yWLA\\--S8Q?si=zuoJ1tO_UM6gsAwG]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/S8yWLA--S8Q?si=zuoJ1tO_UM6gsAwG)"

    "content": "In my distant past, I had a colleague (Let's call him Sam) who was\nworking as a consultant at one of the client locations. This (over)smart\nyoung man was working for two clients simultaneously. No big deal with\nthat however this is what happened. He used to claim for his hotel\naccommodation from both the employers and once from sending his invoice\nof client B to my food chain, he was caught. Embarrassed.\n\n**Multi-tasking, Multi-skilling and Parallelization**\n\nWhen you multi-task to your implied oversmartness or from aiming to be\nvery productive, you will encounter slippery slopes. It happens to all\nof us with small things and big things. I had a messy kitchen this\nweekend as hot tea spilled out from over boiling, owing to a small\ndistraction from another task. Multiple lessons to learn: switch over to\ncoffee, get my house in order before she gets here and realize that\nordinary humans can only perform one task at a time. Sometimes these\nmulti-tasking desires can lead to Sam-like embarrassments, let alone the\nlack of integrity.\n\nMulti-skilling is entirely and at the other end of the spectrum compared\nto multi-tasking. Here you work to prevent obsolescence, simply speaking\nto become resilient in this ever changing world and especially with\npotential disruptions to be seen in the not so distant future. Here you\ncan build or develop brand new skills. As a business person you become a\nreal estate analyst/investor to diversify your portfolio. As a working\nprofessional you become a fitness trainer. As a Marketing Analyst you\nbecome a Public Speaker. As a Software Engineer you become a Solutions\nArchitect. As a Quality Assurance Engineer you become a Business\nAnalyst. As an Employee of an Organization you start a side gig. As a\ncommuter you become a part-time Uber driver. There are so many\npossibilities.\n\nA quick intro to Parallelization. The term 'Parallelization' is largely\nreferred to in computing architecture. CPU uses multiple threads to\nexecute different parts of a program simultaneously. Each thread handles\nseparate tasks improving overall productivity. Does this sound\nOxymoronic compared to the Multi-tasking narrative. Not quite. This is\nabout handling. As a leader sometimes you manage multiple functions, as\na home maker you have several home units to manage and as a\nmulti-skilled talented individual you have the ability to work on\nseveral skills. A key differentiator between multi-tasking and\nparallelization is between how you divide your time in chunks and how\nyou stop doing one thing before you start a new thing, with a seamless\nhand-off.\n\n**Importance of Multi-skilling and Parallelization:**\n\nMany facets of Multi-Skilling\n\n-   Given how easy it is to start a new side gig in the AI-age, everyone\n    > must be encouraged to leverage the tools, learn new skills and\n    > make hay while the sun shines\n\n-   This will also allow you to defend obsolescence of a skill set.

    "content": "# **Characterizing an AI Architect** \n\nOh no, AI again --- don't be scared. As technical as it sounds, anyone\nreading this write-up can aspire to be an AI Architect. Read on. I've\ntried to capture the themes that define an AI Architect or help you\nbuild your AI Architecture. Five characteristics, followed by a\nconcluding question:\n\n### **1. 'AI-Driven' Brand Ambassadors** \n\nAn AI Architect is today's equivalent of a Webmaster.\n\nA webmaster --- now a forgotten term in the AI age --- was once\nresponsible for creating and maintaining a company's internet\nstorefront. She ensured performance, content, functionality, and\nsecurity to manage an organization's online presence.\n\nSimilarly, an AI Architect represents customer-facing AI functions for\nboth internal and external consumers. As we progress, websites will\nincreasingly be replaced by AI Agents. Imagine a branded AI Agent for\ncustomer support instead of a \"Support\" section on a website. The AI\nArchitect builds, coaches, and continuously improves these agents.\n\n### **2. 'Open to All' Opportunity** \n\nAI Architecture is more than technical plumbing. It includes a secured\nAI-enabled front end, design, aesthetics, values, tone of brand, and ---\nimportantly --- the ability to drive business outcomes. Given the\nengineer-like and human-like qualities of today's AI stack,\nprofessionals in User or Customer Experience roles can easily wear this\nhat.\n\n### **3. Thought Leaders** \n\nIn 2022--23, when Large Language Models first emerged, we did not know\nof AI Agents or Model Context Protocols. Model accuracy, capabilities,\nand modalities are improving rapidly, and an AI Architect must\nunderstand where AI is headed, not just where it stands today.\n\nThey analyze problems across time: how they would have been solved six\nmonths ago, how they are solved today, and how they could be solved in\nthe future. For instance, we started with text-only inputs and outputs.\nToday we have text, images, audio, and video. Tomorrow, we will have\nrobotics, AI glasses, and ambient inputs and outputs.\n\nAn AI Architect avoids repeating mistakes of the past. Many\norganizations failed in cloud transitions by simply porting on-premise\nsystems \"as-is.\" Similarly, customer service teams will evolve from\ndirectly and conventionally engaging with customers to instead coaching\nand refining AI agents --- embedding empathy, judgment, and resolution\ninto them.\n\n### **4. Scrappy & Myopic** \n\nAI Architects don't let \"perfect\" be the enemy of \"good.\" They live\niteratively, tolerate risk, and design strategies to improve\npredictability while reducing model hallucinations. This requires\nbuilding a robust data strategy so that models can be trained on\norganizational knowledge and applied to specific functions.\n\nTheir action orientation means not spending six months drafting an AI\nstrategy and another six months implementing it. Instead, they focus\nmyopically on solving real customer and business problems with simple,\nusable AI Agents --- and then refining them using first principles.\n\n### **5. AI Agents --- Buy or Build?** \n\nShould you buy or build your AI Agents?\n\n-   **Buy**: Customer support leaders often prefer ready-to-use\n    > frameworks from companies like Yellow.ai, Five9, Sierra,\n    > Forethought, IBM WatsonX, or Zendesk AI.\n\n-   **Build**: Engineering teams are naturally inclined to design their\n    > own. A homegrown Customer Support Agent requires choosing the\n    > right language model(s), embeddings, vector database, and\n    > integrations with telephony, CRM, knowledge repositories, and\n    > more. It involves planning for testing, upgrades, and model\n    > migrations.\n\n-   **Middle Path**: Platforms with no-code frameworks let you build AI\n    > Agents with a full development lifecycle. They provide tools for\n    > testing, feedback, and improvements, including scenarios where the\n    > agent escalates to a human before going live.\n\n### **Art or Science?** \n\nSo, is AI Architecture an art or a science? Honestly, it has become a\n**commoditized artistic platform built on the fundamentals of science.**\n\nDo you agree?\n\n*Thoughts inspired by:* [[YouTube\nlink]{.underline}](https://youtu.be/C3geUfBR2js?si=3B7pQdX0gurfOyYA)"

Before I get to\nthat, let me go back to my early leadership years. I vividly remember\npresenting a mock topic at a leadership development public speaking\ntraining. I had chosen the wrong topic, froze midway, and embarrassed\nmyself.\n\nFast forward to now, decades later, with training through experience and\nbumpy rides, I found myself presenting our strategy at a townhall\nmeeting. This was my first time addressing such a large gathering in my\nnew role. I had spent 15 hours preparing for a 15-minute talk. Just\nbefore I could get to the virtual podium, I was told my time was cut\nshort to 7 minutes.\n\nDid I freeze? Did I have butterflies in my stomach? Neither.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the years of experience that made the difference. It\nwas a combination of several things:\n\n-   **Preparation matters.** I stared at the content for hours. Even 30\n    > minutes before the session, I hadn't fully finalized my\n    > pitch---not because I wasn't confident, but because I kept\n    > refining the message.\n\n-   **Adversity strengthens character.** Instead of worrying about my\n    > time being halved, I trained my mind to view these moments as\n    > steps toward success.\n\n-   **Expect the unexpected.** My years of working with Private Equity\n    > firms were the best training. They set the bar high---not only for\n    > returns but for people. Every presentation taught me one\n    > certainty: always expect the unexpected.\n\n-   **Connection over content.** What ultimately matters most is how you\n    > connect with your audience---what's in it for them.\n\nAnd here's a thought I keep repeating: kids today use AI as an assistant\nin their studies. Teachers, knowing this, now expect 8th graders to\nperform at graduate level. If that's what we expect of the next\ngeneration, why should we expect less of ourselves? Leverage tools---AI\nincluded---to shape your narratives. Doing so makes it much easier to\nrespond to the unexpected.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n-   Build an appetite to step out of your comfort zone---often.\n\n-   Make yourself visible, no matter how visible you already are.\n\n-   Look for moments and opportunities---they don't always knock on your\n    > door.\n\n-   Practice, practice, practice---don't let fear fuel self-doubt.\n\n-   Be bold enough to strike conversations with anyone.\n\n-   Turn your butterflies into the **butterfly effect.\\\n    > **\n\nIn chaos theory, the butterfly effect suggests that a butterfly flapping\nits wings in one part of the world could contribute to a tornado or\nstorm in another. Tiny actions, seemingly insignificant, can create\nlarge and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nSo, the next time you feel butterflies in your stomach, remember: they\ncould be the very wings that set a storm of success in motion."

    "content": "The Subtle Art of Getting Things Done\n\nI've been dissecting a short podcast and, believe me, the podcast is far more entertaining in value than what you will learn from this Sunday capsule. Still, with the occasional miss, my job is to write—so I am writing, irrespective. Here are some lessons of life.\n\nOptimist or Pessimist?\n\nThere is no upside to optimism; one should rather be a pessimist. Over the years, we've been conditioned to always be hopeful. This time, let's weigh the value of being a pessimist.\n\nImagine giving your manager or client a deadline to deliver a proposal by Friday close of business. Instead, you submit it Thursday evening—complete, polished, and with tips they didn't expect. You not only beat the deadline but also add unexpected value. That's the power of underpromising and overdelivering.\n\nNever Let Them Know What They're Working Toward\n\nThink of a pawn in chess: the smallest, most ordinary piece. Its only instruction is to move one square forward. Nothing glamorous, nothing heroic. The pawn doesn't know that by simply following this humble rule, one step at a time, it may reach the other side of the board and transform into a queen.\n\nSimilarly, when you read one book a month or write one page a day, you build compounding habits that one day transform you into a critical thinker capable of solving life's hardest problems.\n\nPunctuality\n\nMany workplaces accept meetings starting 5–10 minutes late. But if six people sit waiting for two stragglers, that's an hour of collective time wasted.\n\nPunctuality follows a simple rule: being early is on time, being on time is late, and being late makes you the punchline.\n\nDon't Work Your Way Up the Ladder\n\nIncrementalism rarely gets you to the top. Disruption does. True breakthroughs come from challenging norms, not following them. Airbnb redefined hospitality, Uber redefined transportation, and Full Self Driving is redefining mobility. Astonishing results demand disruptive thinking, not small steps up the ladder.\n\nLet It Be Their Decision\n\nHenry Ford famously said, \"You can have a car of any color, as long as it's black.\" Contrast that with today, where customers demand customization, choices, and delightful surprises. Apple didn't just give people what they asked for—they designed products that became indispensable.\n\nJony Ive and Sam Altman are now collaborating to design AI-native hardware. Their genius will be in letting people perceive the product as their own desired choice.\n\nStandout and Don't Stand Out\n\nIf you're at the edge of a group photo, you might look wider—or worse, be cropped out. The trick is finding the right place, the right people, and the right opportunities to achieve scale.\n\nOut-Juvenile a Screaming Body\n\nBullies don't disappear after school; they reappear in workplaces, bringing toxicity. Don't let them win. Build a Fort Knox of capabilities and confidence. Use your voice. Stand your ground.\n\nAssimilate First, Then Shine\n\nWhen you enter a new workplace or culture, understand its conventions. Learn the idioms: \"all bases loaded\" in the U.S., \"sticky wicket\" in India, \"red card\" in Europe. Blend in first.\n\nOnce you've marked your presence and built your brand, reveal your authentic self. Authenticity, more than anything else, will carry you forward.\n\nThis piece took me a while to write, especially as I translated Barry Sonnenfeld's PodFuncast into this capsule. But the lessons are worth the effort."

    },
    "inCurriculum": true,
    "content": "Bullying and Condescension\n\nWhile writing this week, I looked up the origin of the word bully, assuming it had something to do with being \"bull-like.\" Actually, not quite.\n\nBully originated in the 16th century from the Dutch word boel, meaning affectionate lover, brother, or sweetheart. Over the years, it shifted into describing someone who pushed love and affection too forcefully. Today, of course, a bully is understood as someone who habitually mistreats those perceived as weaker.\n\nCondescension—or condescending behavior—is about belittling others. In both bullying and condescension, the weaker ones are diminished.\n\nIn childhood, overt bullying often manifests as physical or verbal abuse. Covert bullying is subtler—exclusion from games or social groups. Condescension, meanwhile, shows up as superiority through wealth, skills, or status. Both mistreat those considered weaker.\n\nIn Organizations\n\nIn established organizations, bullies rarely show up with physical aggression; that would get them out the door quickly. Instead, they adopt condescending behaviors. We'll use the terms interchangeably here. Why do they condescend?\n\n-   A newcomer trying to fit in may overemphasize how things were done in a prior job.\n\n-   Some leverage implicit expectations from the food chain, acting as though they know the \"secret sauce\" of what management or customers want.\n\n-   Patronizing tones instill fear, often covering up their own insecurities.\n\n-   Their social life outside work is constrained; they may themselves be bullied at home by a dominating partner.\n\n-   They feel unappreciated or unrecognized.\n\n-   They seek to protect underperforming peers from being exposed by your competence.\n\nAnd surely, there are more reasons.\n\nHow Do You Deal With Them?\n\nThe Being/Doing Part\n\n-   Show up every day to give your best to your assignment.\n\n-   Connect your contributions to the mission and purpose of the larger organization.\n\n-   Ensure your work and value creation are impeccable.\n\n-   Build relationships with colleagues who can foster your intellectual development.\n\n-   Avoid watercooler conversations.\n\n-   Create a strong narrative of your contributions and share your impact periodically—without overplaying your trumpet.\n\nThe Mental Being\n\n-   If their behavior keeps you restless or sleepless despite your strong performance, then you're part of the problem too.\n\n-   Recognize that they have minimal control over your assignments, career, or rewards.\n\n-   Focus on continuously raising your bar on the being/doing side.\n\n-   Build a plan with a longer horizon than this individual's potential success.\n\n-   Don't be distracted by the fact that some thrive by \"sweet talk.\" Like excessive sugar in the system, it eventually takes its toll.\n\nThe Giving Back Part\n\n-   If your workplace fosters open-door culture, knock and have an honest conversation.\n\n-   Acknowledge strengths where you see them; if you can't find any, don't overengineer praise.\n\n-   Tell the person directly how their behavior affects you and its impact on your work and mental well-being.\n\n-   Be direct and objective—this isn't the place for subtlety.\n\n-   Document instances. At some point, you may need factual records.\n\nI've also seen younger professionals take a more intolerant stand: they demonstrate courage to have direct conversations and, importantly, the courage to walk out of toxic workplaces.\n\nA Final Reflection\n\nHow do you want to be remembered? While processing this, don't assume you yourself are never a bully. It's possible—unknowingly—you may be one. Seek continuous feedback and self-assess.\n\nImagine a disgruntled co-worker who leaves a job and tells her new colleagues in the break room:\n\n  \"When this great ex-manager who isn't around anymore looks down at me…\"\n  (a sarcastic sob and pause) \"…Not from the heavens. He was just condescending.\"\n\nThat's the thing—condescension makes others feel like living ghosts hovering beneath you. The idea is not to become the villain in someone else's horror story."

I will follow up shortly to write about the\nsecond one and get into how individuals and economies can plan and\nrespond to these stimuli.\n\nHere we go with definitions first. It does not harm even if they repeat.\nIf you are familiar with these definitions, then you can skip to the\nmain update following the five definitions below.\n\n**CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Remember the big desktop machines\nthat had largely three parts --- a display screen, keyboard/mouse, and a\nbig box that we used to call a CPU. I am not referring to the big box,\nbut to the main chip inside those big boxes and now in your laptops and\nsmartphones. A CPU is a general-purpose processor that executes computer\ninstructions, manages logic, control, and computation across diverse\napplications efficiently.\n\n**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** In 2012--13, when I was working for\nMSC Software, we had access to a GPU card from NVIDIA when we had no\nidea that this provider would become the world's most valued company in\n2025. The same GPU --- with many advanced versions from that point on\n--- is now used to accelerate large-scale mathematical computations in\nAI, namely the build-out of Large Language Models.\n\n**DPU (Data Processing Unit):** NVIDIA also now builds and sells DPUs,\nwhich offload data movement, encryption, and virtualization tasks from\nCPUs for efficient cloud workloads. As such, both GPUs and DPUs work as\nco-processors or copilots to the CPUs.\n\n**TPU (Tensor Processing Unit):** Google built this AI-specific\nprocessor to accelerate deep-learning matrix operations, optimizing\nperformance for neural network training and inference.\n\n**QPU (Quantum Processing Unit):** QPUs will be used to perform\nmassively parallel probabilistic computations beyond classical limits.\nFor now, just appreciate the reference to \"probabilistic\" and \"quantum\"\ncontexts as these will be closely tied to the principles of quantum\nmechanics as leveraged in quantum computations.\n\nThe reason for mentioning these five processors is to appreciate that\nNVIDIA will play in the space of GPUs, DPUs, and QPUs in the long run.\nGoogle will continue evolving the TPU space. And the fact remains that\nCPUs have existed historically for a very, very long time --- ever since\nthe introduction of computers to mankind.\n\n### **NVIDIA from"

    "content": "# **Telescope or Microscope** \n\nEvery so often, you meet someone who proudly proclaims, \"I don't get\npaid to do that.\" This thinking is the opposite of what fuels great\ncareers, great teams, and great organizations. So let's borrow two\nmagnificent tools from science to rewire how we look at work.\n\nOn one side: the James Webb Space Telescope, scanning galaxies 13\nbillion years away and expanding our sense of what's possible. On the\nother: nanotechnology, operating at the scale of molecules, proving that\nthe smallest moves can transform entire industries. One widens\nimagination; the other sharpens precision. In today's world---be it\ncorporate, entrepreneurial, artistic, medical, or professional---we need\nboth.\n\nBut mindset transformation begins with choosing the telescope first.\n\n## **1. The Telescoping View: Seeing Beyond the Ordinary** \n\nZoom out far enough, and your job description becomes a\nfootnote---useful, but hardly the full story. A telescopic mindset helps\nyou recognize how your role connects across the constellation of people:\ncustomers, colleagues, partners, society, and the future you are\nshaping.\n\nWith that view, even everyday tasks become mission-linked.\n\n-   A developer isn't checking in code; they're contributing to\n    > reliability that drives revenue.\n\n-   A cashier isn't just scanning items; they're shaping a moment that\n    > defines whether a customer returns\n\n-   A physician isn't simply diagnosing; they're restoring someone's\n    > ability to return to life, family, and purpose\n\nThrough the telescope, lines in a job description blur, and horizons of\nimpact sharpen.\n\n## **2. Doing More Than What's Asked --- For the Right Intent** \n\nDoing more is not about burnout, martyrdom, or being the \"office hero.\"\nIt's about thoughtful contributions rooted in the bigger mission. When\nyou act with telescopic awareness, your bar rises naturally.\n\n-   You preempt risks instead of reacting.\n\n-   You improve inefficient processes because they slow down everyone,\n    > not because someone told you to.\n\n-   You step into gaps because you care about outcomes, not because your\n    > title authorizes it.\n\nThis isn't overwork. It's ownership.\n\nPeople who think this way grow faster, lead earlier, and build\nreputational equity that outlasts any role. They aren't valuable because\nthey do more---they're valuable because they see more.\n\n## **3. The Five Lenses: The CORE+ Framework** \n\nTo simplify the five behaviors into something memorable, here's a\nfive-letter acronym: CORE+.\n\nEach letter captures a mindset that transcends titles, industries,\nseniority, and professions.\n\n**C --- Customer-Cognitive Mindset\\\n** Think like the customer you are serving. Anticipate their needs,\ninterpret what they truly want, and design your actions around their\nexperience. The best professionals read the room, the data, and the\nunstated expectations.\n\n**O --- Ownership for Value & Growth\\\n** Everything you touch should improve something: revenue, trust,\nefficiency, safety, reliability, or skill. People with an ownership\nmindset don't wait to be assigned value---they create it.\n\n**R --- Results Through Product Thinking\\\n** Whatever you produce---a report, a legal brief, a diagnosis, a\nmarketing plan, a service interaction---is a \"product\" of your thinking.\nTreat it like an artifact the world will use and judge. Quality becomes\nyour signature.\n\n**E --- Excellence in Service Orientation\\\n** Service is not subservience. It's clarity about why your role exists:\nto enable someone else's outcome. Leaders, creators, analysts,\nphysicians, engineers---all serve someone. When service becomes a\nmindset, not a function, your influence multiplies.\n\n**+ --- Culture Creation\\\n** The plus sign symbolizes your force multiplier. Culture is shaped by\nmicro-behaviors: how you respond under stress, how you treat colleagues,\nhow you share credit, how you listen, and how you show up. People who\nelevate culture uplift entire systems.\n\nTogether, CORE+ forms the foundation of working beyond the narrow\nboundaries of \"what's written in my job description.\"\n\n## **4. Redefining Monday --- and the New Year Ahead** \n\nHere's the truth: the gap between average and exceptional is measured in\ntiny adjustments, not massive reinventions. Your next Monday starts with\na telescopic question:\n\n**\"What's the bigger mission my role contributes to?\"**\n\nThen a microscopic one:\n\n**\"What single action today can elevate value, culture, or customer\nexperience?\"**\n\nYour new Monday might involve:\n\n-   closing one cross-functional gap that no one owns,\n\n-   improving one broken process,\n\n-   helping one colleague without prompting,\n\n-   listening to one customer more deeply,\n\n-   driving one behavior that strengthens CORE+.\n\nLive this every week, and your new year resolution becomes\nself-fulfilling:\\\n**Expand your field of vision, shrink your excuses.**\n\nMy next piece will focus on the art of acting without explicit\ninstructions---building a super-cognitive awareness of the world around\nyou. Today was the telescope; next time, we will pick up the microscope."

    "content": "**Benchmarking for the Art of (Im)possible**\n\nWe have heard that we are the average of the five people closest to us.\nThough it sounds relatively simple and comforting, it is dangerously\nincomplete. More on why?\n\nWe have strange habits when it comes to benchmarks. We benchmark by\nwealth, wisdom, character and most importantly by accomplishments. The\nimplicit mind also keeps underperformers close, not out of compassion,\nbut convenience. We can tell them, advise them and flaunt our being in\nfront of them. They act as our emotional mirrors, reassuring us that we\nare doing fine and better than them. It is like buying dopamine for free\nleading to temporary happiness and zero growth. This sometimes gets into\nlazy benchmarking. Also, your mind does not know that this is happening.\nWe confuse comfort with progress. And then, we wonder why years pass\nwithout significant progress.\n\nHigh achievers, in contradiction, work differently. They benchmark\nagainst people who make them uncomfortable. They study those who prepare\nmore obsessively, persevere longer when motivation fades, and practice\neven when no one is watching. They pay attention not just to what is\ndelivered, but how it is wrapped---the storytelling, the packaging, the\nability to move ideas from raw intelligence to compelling narratives.\n\nThis is where the shift happens---from the art of the possible to the\nart of the impossible. This shift begins with choosing better\nbenchmarks.\n\nLet me share a real example. It\\'s 2:00 a.m. in India. Middle of the\nweek. The night of his birthday. Tarun just turned 25. His evening\nmoving into late night would have been like loud music, drinks galore,\nand tomorrow written off in advance.\n\nAt 2 a.m., Tarun is not sloshed. He was inquisitive. He was asking\nquestions that most people don\\'t ask until their late thirties---if\never. I was in New York and he along with his teammate found me since it\nwas a convenient time for me to be available. He spent the hour with me\nspeaking about preparation, perseverance, and practice---not as\nmotivational words, but as systems. He was dissecting how high\nperformers think, how they tell their stories, how they raise standards\nquietly and relentlessly. On his birthday. That is not a\ncoincidence---that is benchmarking.\n\nTarun isn\\'t measuring himself against the average 25-year-old. He\\'s\nbenchmarking against a future version of excellence---and working\nbackwards.\n\nAre your benchmarks making you comfortable---or making you better?\n\n**The 4Ps: A Framework for Upward Benchmarking**\n\nHigh achievers, consciously or otherwise, benchmark across four\ndimensions. Let\\'s call them the 4Ps.\n\n**1. Preparation:** Preparation is invisible work---you show up early,\nleave late, and compound quietly. People who benchmark upward obsess\nover inputs, not outcomes. They simulate scenarios before they occur. My\nfavorite with that is from the years of learning from Dominic Gallello,\nmy favorite leader. You walk into his meetings expecting the unexpected.\n\nAverage performers prepare just enough to survive. High performers\nprepare enough to expect the unexpected.\n\n**2. Perseverance:** Perseverance is misunderstood as grit. It\\'s not.\nRather, the benchmark shifts from \\\"Can I do this?\\\" to \\\"Can I stay\nwith this longer than others?\\\"\n\n**3. Packaging (The Forgotten Multiplier):** Ideas don\\'t travel unless\nthey\\'re packaged. Storytelling is not fluff---it\\'s leverage. The best\nperformers study how ideas are framed, not just formed. They watch how\nleaders simplify complexity, how narratives are built, how timing and\ntone matter.\n\n**4. Possibility → Impossibility:** This is the final leap. Most\nbenchmarks live in the realm of the possible: realistic goals,\nincremental growth, sensible ambition. Necessary---but insufficient.\n\nThe great benchmarks operate in the realm of the impossible, the 10x\nthinking and the force multiplier.\n\nThis trait alone separates followers from hallmarks. Do you have\nimplicit bias for comforting benchmarks? Have you thought of your 10x\ngoals? Do your biases prevent you from 10x expectations?"

    "content": "**Is your life a Nextflix Revenge Series?**\n\n**No Enemies, Only Elevation:** Most always our implicit thinking is\nabout how we are seen and how we want to respond to get back at\nsomething. We think with the 'tit for tat' mind, a scorekeeping behavior\nor retaliatory reciprocation. Someone ignores you, you ignore them back.\nSomeone blocks you, you return the favor---emotionally, socially,\nprofessionally. It feels fair and balanced, however it is deeply\nunproductive.\n\nYour competition is not with people, but standards. Standards of\nthinking, standards of behavior, standards of growth - the standards you\nset for yourself. Families, friendships, teams, and organizations are\nnot battlegrounds; they are arenas where we either elevate each other or\nslowly decay through scorekeeping.\n\nAt work, tit-for-tat shows up quietly. A colleague doesn't credit you in\na meeting, so you withhold information next time. A manager challenges\nyour idea publicly, so you disengage privately. The relationship becomes\ntransactional, brittle, and small. The irony? The real\ncompetition---market forces, smarter startups, faster\ntechnologies---don't care about your internal cold war.\n\nAt home and socially, the pattern repeats. \"I called last time.\" \"They\ndidn't show up for me.\" Relationships turn into spreadsheets. But human\nbonds don't compound through arithmetic; they compound through\ngenerosity and context. Often, people are not against you---they are\nsimply dealing with something you cannot see.\n\n**Wearing the other Person's Shoes:** Which brings us to a critical\nmuscle most of us undertrain: *seeing what you don't see*. Our cognitive\nbiases love stories about heroes, villains, success, failures, and\nglamour. Reality is messier. We tend to operate with partial\ninformation, hidden pressures, and expectations for outcomes, eventually\nto realize we did not get what we expected in the first place. Expecting\nthe unexpected isn't pessimism; it's maturity. When you pause and ask,\n\"What might I be missing?\" you dissolve conflicts before they harden.\n\nThis matters even more today because many of our \"rooms\" are invisible.\nThey are not conference rooms but video tiles, delayed replies, or just\na voice on a call across time zones. Tone collapses in emails. We often\nmisread responses or lack thereof as resistance.\n\nWatercooler conversations are even more dangerous. Hearsay from a third\nperson---often incomplete---cements opinions before direct engagement.\nReading an invisible room requires slowing down, listening for what\nisn't said, and checking assumptions early---before imaginary enemies\nform.\n\nThis needs a fix of proximity---to influential people. Not influential\nby title alone, but by gravity. People who raise the quality of\nconversation, think in systems, and stay calm under pressure. You find\nthem by observing who others turn to when things go wrong. You approach\nthem not with asks, but with curiosity.\n\n**So how do we start afresh in 2026?** Rewire your minds with a\nlong-game logic. Set a very high bar and standards, somewhat\nhyperbolically impossible to achieve. Work hard to live up to your high\nbar expectations Assume positive intent until proven otherwise---and\neven then, respond with clarity, not retaliation. Widen your lens. Be\ndeliberate about the rooms you enter, visible or invisible. Choose\ncircles that stretch you.\n\nOnce you can commit to wire your mind to this thinking, you can set\nfunctional or performance goals.\n\n#  \n\n#"
